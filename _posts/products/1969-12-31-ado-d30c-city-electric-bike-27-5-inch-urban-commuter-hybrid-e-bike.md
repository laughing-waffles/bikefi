## ADO D30C City High-Performance Hybrid Electric Road Bike

### The Supreme City Hauler

Featuring a sturdy, lightweight aluminum build, Shimano 9-speed transmission,
an **ultra-long-range** of 90km (56mi), and a super-cool set of features, the
ADO D30C **City Electric Bike** is built to perfectly complement your city
life!

The weight of **only 22kg** (48lbs) is a true **feather weight** for this
category, agility during driving and practicality in transport gains a lot.
Even pedaling without assistance is not as tiring as with other models.  
The ADO D30C mounts **27.5-inch CST All Terrain tires** , 1.95″ wide, with
moderate tread pattern that offers good comfort on the road but also good grip
on dirt.

### Class-Leading Battery

The ADO D30C City Electric Bike has a high-quality **detachable 10.4Ah
Lithium-ion battery**. This class-leading battery allows for an ultra-long-
range of 90km (56mi) ans comes with a number of protective features – ranging
from temperature damage to over-discharge and short circuit protection. And
thanks to a detachable design, the battery is convenient to carry and replace.  
The battery is well integrated into the frame and almost invisible, it can be
removed using the supplied key to recharge it comfortably at home or for
safety reasons.

### High-Speed Brushless Motor

The ADO D30C comes equipped with a powerful 250W brushless DC motor that
delivers a hefty 42Nm of torque. Unlike traditional motors, the brushless
motor of the D30C uses a more efficient and energy-saving commutating
mechanism to prolong battery life. Moreover, there’s little to no maintenance
required to keep the motor in shape.

### Hydraulic Disc Brakes

ADO has ensured complete rider safety by equipping the D30C with super-durable
**hydraulic disc brakes** at both front and rear to guarantee effortless and
quick stoppage at all times.

### Interactive Shock Absorbers

The ADO D30C has an interactive **shock absorber system** that not only
smoothens your rides but also lets you adapt to various road conditions. With
a simple click of a button, you can change the wire-controlled shock absorber
mechanism to suit the terrain you’re riding on!

### Ultra-Precise Controller

The ADO D30C comes with the **G-Drive 2.0 control system** which acts as the
brain of the e-bike. It calculates how much pedal assist is required in real-
time, making the ride feel natural and seamless. Moreover, G-Drive uses
frequency conversion techniques to receive and transmit signals quickly and
efficiently.
