## Maxxis Shorty 27.5" Tire

Maxxis’s popular mid-spike mud tire is back and now redesigned with a new
tread pattern, multiple casing options and is now available in a 2.4WT” width.
The new tread pattern is more balanced, includes sipping on the tread, has
improved cornering knobs and raised edges for mud clearing. The large double-
wide block on the old shorty has been split into two individual blocks for
improved rolling resistance. The Shorty is available in both 3C MaxxGrip and
3C MaxxTerra rubber compounds, with the Double Down and DH casings only
available for the MaxxGrip compound and Maxxis’s EXO protection only available
for the MaxxTerra compound. If you regularly find yourself trying to get
through loose and muddy terrain, blown out corners or other less than ideal
conditions, then the Maxxis Shorty is your tire.

### Features

  * **Redesigned tread pattern** with more supportive cornering knobs, sipped tread and raised edges for mud clearing
  * **3C MaxxTerra** balance of grip, low rolling resistance and slow rebound properties.
  * **3C MaxxGrip** offers the ultimate grip and traction.
  * **DoubleDown** dual-ply casing for durability, 120 X 2 TPI and butyl insert sidewall protection.
  * **DH casing** the most protective casing Maxxis offers, two layers of 60TPI and reinforced butyl insert sidewall protection.
  * **EXO protection** sidewall cut and abrasion resistance.
  * **Tubeless Ready** Allows you to run the tires tubeless.
