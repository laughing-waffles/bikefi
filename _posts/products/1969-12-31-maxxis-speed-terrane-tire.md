## Maxxis Speed Terrane Tire

### Keep Crossin'

Grab the holeshot and don't look back! The Maxxis Speed Terrane tire is a
cyclocross race tire designed to excel in grass and hardpack conditions. The
Micro-diamond knobs cover the tread surface awarding the rider with blazing
fast speeds, while the stacked paddle knobs down the middle provide unrivaled
climbing and braking traction. The siped and offset cornering knobs dig in to
give you support so you can push your tires hard into any corner. EXO
protection fights off sidewall damage so you can worry less about your tires
and more about winning races. This tire is tubeless-ready so you can ditch the
tubes for a smoother ride, better traction, and fewer flats.

### Features

  * **Micro-diamond tread** helps you roll fast
  * **Aggressive side knobs** for controlled cornering
  * **Tubeless-ready** for a smoother ride, better traction, and fewer flats
