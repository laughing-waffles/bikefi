## Juliana Wilder 1 C S TR Bike 2022

### Go Ride Wilder

Trail bikes are a great way to conquer the singletrack. They are great at
climbing, can accelerate on the flats, and descend like a champ. Trail bikes
are perfect for someone who wants a bike that is a little more aggressive and
capable than an XC bike. The Juliana Wilder 1 C S TR Bike takes all the
acceleration and sprint qualities of a carbon XC bike and fuses them with a
rear-end that still rails corners like a hardcore trail bike. It has a Carbon
C frame that uses 120mm of travel on the front and 115mm of travel on the
rear. The frame features internal cable routing, integrated frame protection,
two bottle mounts, clearance for up to 2.4" tires, and a Superlight Suspension
System.

The S version of the Juliana Wilder 1 C TR Bike comes with a SRAM GX Eagle
12-speed drivetrain. This includes a cassette that has a hill-crushing 10-50T
gear range that makes climbing and pedaling through rough terrain a breeze.
SRAM Level TL hydraulic disc brakes provide excellent stopping power so you
can descend under control. RaceFace AR Offset 27 29" Wheels are paired with
Maxxis Rekon Race tires that can be set up tubeless for a smoother ride,
better traction, and fewer flats. With the RockShox Reverb Stealth Dropper
Post, you'll be able to quickly lift and lower your saddle with the press of a
lever.
