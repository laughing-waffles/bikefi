## Specialized Rhythm Lite 12” Tire

The Specialized Rhythm Lite Tire is a versatile tire that can catch a rhythm
in almost any terrain. With a fast-rolling center tread, and spaced-out
transition knobs, the Rhythm Lite rolls fast and has excellent traction on
hardpacked dirt trails, concrete, or asphalt. This tire features Flak Jacket
protection which helps to drastically reduce punctures by integrating a
puncture-resistant aramid material into the casing. A wire bead makes this
tire stiff and more resilient and a 70a rubber compound is durable and can
handle youth shenanigans.
