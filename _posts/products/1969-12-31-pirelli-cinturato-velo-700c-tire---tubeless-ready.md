## Pirelli Cinturato Velo 700c Tire - Tubeless Ready

Pirelli, a name synonymous with premium, high-end style, is an Italian Icon in
the automotive industry, with roots deeply embedded in racing culture. Their
exemplary tires arent limited to motor vehicles, though. They also build
relentlessly fast road racing tires, and their new Pirelli Cinturato Velo 700c
Tire - Tubeless Ready is a testament to that. These tires are unique in their
ability to handle well in wet and dry conditions, provide comfort, and offer
lasting grip—a list of assets achieved by few, if any, tire manufacturers.
They're also tubeless ready.

Needless to say, many years of work and expiramentation are behind the road
tires by Pirelli. These tires feature Pirelli’s SmartNET Silica, which offers
excellent rolling efficiency and grip in both wet and dry settings, providing
you with an all-season tire with outstanding performance. The tread design was
developed with FGD and ICS technologies, allowing it to handle water drainage
efficiently, even in harsh weather conditions. They also feature excellent
puncture resistance, and can bear many miles before comfort or grip are
sacrificed.

### Features

  * **Pirelli's SmartNET™ Silica** grants both rolling efficiency and wet grip
  * **Tread design developed with FGD and ICS technologies** provides great handling and water drainage, even in harsh weather conditions
  * **Overall increased SmartNET™ Silica tread pattern thickness in addition to an aramid fiber puncture-resistant belt** ensures extensive mileage and reliability in bad weather and cold temperatures
  * **Aramid fiber anti puncture**
