## Shimano GRX FC-RX810-1 Crankset

### HOLLOWTECH II Crankset

Designed to conquer rough gravel roads and any combination of dust and mud,
the Shimano GRX series will give you comfortable, stress-free performance no
matter how rowdy the trail gets. The 11-speed GRX FC-RX810-1 crankset provides
you with tighter gear steps to maintain rhythm on familiar routes, optimum
gearing for mixed terrain, and a simple design that shares the same crankset
among both 1x and 2x models. Continuing with simplicity, the category-leading
GRX 800-series can be seamlessly combined with any GRX 600-series components.
As with all Shimano cranksets, the GRX crankset features a 2-piece design that
utilizes Shimano's Hollowtech II technology. All GRX cranksets also use a new,
+2.5mm chainline for increased tire and frame clearance.
