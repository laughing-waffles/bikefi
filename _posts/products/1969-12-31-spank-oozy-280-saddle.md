## SPANK OOZY 280 SADDLE

### SPANKING THE COMPETITION

If you're out putting in the miles on your mountain bike, then you're going to
want to have an excellent saddle underneath you. A comfortable saddle will
make it easier to ride long distances since it helps reduce fatigue. The Spank
Oozy 280 Saddle balances the padded comfort that many trail riders demand with
the sleek profile that aggressive riders and racers desire. It has a
relatively flat upper shape that maximizes the rider movement and the adaptive
edges in high friction areas contour to the rider's personal shape and
movement.

### Features

  * **Co-molded construction** with reinforced Impact Zones and Tuned Flex Points
  * **Human Factor ergonomic design** with a pronounced Relief Channel that reduces pressure
  * **Adaptive edges in high friction areas** contour to a rider's personal shape and movement
