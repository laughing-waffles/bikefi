## Kenda Hellkat 27.5” DH Tire

### A gravity and enduro weapon

Kenda created the Hellkat Tire in development with their UR DH World Cup team.
It features an optimized tread pattern perfect for gravity and enduro
applications. This tire won’t let you down through sharp turns or during
aggressive braking. The Hellkat tire comes with one of three casings which are
listed below.

**AGC (AGC) -** The Advanced Gravity Casing (AGC) is Kenda‘s latest innovation
for gravity orientated riders. A strip of Kenda Vector Shield, a lightweight
material of woven aramid, is built in under the tread area and along the
sidewalls to protect from punctures and cuts. It offers nearly three times
more cut resistance than standard protective materials. A 20mm apex along the
bead prevents pinch flats and burping. Our lightest and strongest gravity
casing up to date.

**AEC (AEC) -** The new AEC casing fills the gap between the burly Advanced
Gravity Casing (AGC) and the weight-optimized Advanced Trail Casing (ATC).
Using the same 3-piece aramid inserts as the AGC casing, AEC omits the apex,
which saves weight, but guarantees the same high level of puncture and cut
resistance.

**ATC (ATC) -** Optimized for enduro and trail riding, the Advanced Trail
Casing (ATC) uses a layer of SCT on the sidewalls and a K-Armor belt under the
tread area. K-Armor allows for a tighter weave and the use of less rubber,
resulting in a lighter tire and a casing that is supple enough to allow the
knobs to flex and form under load, yet still protects from pinch flats or
casing tears.

### Features

  * **The latest compound technology** Dual layer compound for extra grip and control, or dual tread compound for longer tread life
  * **Versatile** Tread design is optimized for a wide range of conditions balancing traction, handling and rolling speed
  * **Tubeless ready** Saves weight and provides a better rolling performance and more controlled handling. Riding tubeless also reduces the chance of flats
