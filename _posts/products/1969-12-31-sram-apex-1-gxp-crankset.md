## SRAM Apex 1 GXP Crankset

### THE VALUE OF SIMPLICITY

The efficiency, and simplicity of the 1x drivetrain has rightfully made its
way in to the Road, CX, Gravel Grind, and even Urban scene. SRAM's Apex 1 lets
you reap the benefits of the 1x drivetrain at a price point that will be
pleasing to the budget conscience. The SRAM Apex 1 crankset brings quiet
simplicity thanks to SRAM 1x technology. Featuring SRAM's X-SYNC tooth
profile, the Apex 1 crankset is engineered for complete chain control at a
great value. Each tooth's thickness is CNC-machined to work seamlessly with
the chain's inner and outer links

NOTE: BB not included
