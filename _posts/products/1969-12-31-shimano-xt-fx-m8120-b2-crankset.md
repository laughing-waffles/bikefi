## Shimano XT FC-M8120-B2 Crankset

### The new generation of XT

Since their introduction many years ago, Shimano Hollowtech cranks have been
the best cranks you can put on a mountain bike. Extremely strong, remarkably
lightweight, and stiffer than a straight shot of whiskey. The crankarm
construction exemplifies the level of craftsmanship that's put into a Shimano
crankset, utilizing a 3D hollow bonded structure to further reduce weight and
increase stiffness. Chainrings are easily exchanged with the new direct-mount
system and the cranks can be swapped between single and double front chainring
setups.
