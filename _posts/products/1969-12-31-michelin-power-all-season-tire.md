## Michelin Power All Season Tire

True to its name, a Michelin Power All Season tire with Grip compound rubber,
provides excellent control, and low rolling resistance in most riding
conditions. The Aramid Protek + belt is an extra belt of protection under the
tread and shoulders of the casing and can offer a bit of insurance when you
have to get through those sections of the route that the street sweeper never
manages to get to. Take a glance at the tread wear indicator now and then and
be on top of your bikes needs and enjoy traction and control every ride. Rain
or shine.

### Features

  * Michelin Grip compound rubber to provide low rolling resistance, and provide extra grip in wet and cold conditions
  * Triple layer 60 tpi casing with puncture-resistant crown ply for comfort and durability
  * Tread siping on shoulders to provide additional cornering traction
  * Aramid Protek + belt under tread and shoulders to provide puncture protection
  * Tread Wear Indicator molded into tire tread
