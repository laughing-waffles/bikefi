## Fox Float DPS Factory Trunnion 2022

### Exceptional Efficiency

The Fox Float DPS Factory is designed to offer exceptional performance,
efficiency, and compliance in a small package. The lightweight chassis keeps
the overall shock weight to a minimum. The EVOL air sleeve paired with a Dual
Piston valve design allows the DPS Factory to soak up bumps and big hits while
also being as efficient as possible when putting down the power. Compression
and rebound adjustments allow you to dial in the performance. Kashima coating
is incredibly smooth and keeps the shock operating with maximum efficiency.
The DPS Factory is equally at home on the start line of a UCI World Cup race
or an all day epic at your local trail network.

### Features:

  * **EVOL air sleeve** improves responsiveness and sensitivity
  * **Dual Piston design** improves rebound and compression flow
  * **Kashima coating** keeps the shock running as smooth as possible
  * **DPS damper with three positions** open, medium, and firm
