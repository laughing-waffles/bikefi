## Schwalbe Lugano II 700c Tire

### Entry-level price, top tier performance

Schwalbe’s Lugano II takes the term entry-level up a notch. With K-Guard
puncture protection you’ll be able to keep your head down and focus on putting
out watts without having to worry about stopping to fix a flat. The use of
Schwalbe’s Silica compound paired with fast rolling design and a 50-EPI
carcass offers excellent road grip and solid rolling resistance. The inclusion
of a folding bead design makes installing and removing the Lugano II’s a pain
free process. Simply put, if you’re looking for an affordable tire that
punches far above its price category then look no further than the Schwalbe
Lugano II tire.

### Features

  * **K-Guard puncture protection** keeps you on the bike instead of on the road side
