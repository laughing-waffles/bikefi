## Camelbak Hydrobak Light 50oz

When you need to carry water and only a few essential items, the Camelbak
Hydrobak Light has you covered. The Hydrobak Light is a minimalistic and
lightweight hydration pack that is designed for lightweight trail riding.
Featuring a 1.5-liter or 50oz hydration capacity and enough room for 1-liter
of storage space, the 2021 Camelbak Hydrobak Light is the perfect choice for
riders who are looking to keep the extra weight to a minimum. Camelbak went
with their Air Support Light Back Panel for a super-lightweight and breathable
construction and the shoulder straps are also completely mesh for adequate
airflow. A small zippered pocket on the side of the bag provides enough room
for your riding essentials and you can even stow your helmet on your bag with
the integrated handle at the top of the bag. Other notable features that were
included on the Hydrobak are an integrated light loop on the rear of the bag
so you can clip on a taillight and plastic tube traps help keep your hydration
tube in place. Finally, the Hydrobak Light features reflective accents for
nighttime visibility.
