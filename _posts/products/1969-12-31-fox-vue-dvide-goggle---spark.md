## Fox Vue DVIDE Goggle

After countless hours of research, development, and testing, the Fox Vue Dvide
Goggles came to life. They fit close to the face, reducing distractions from
the side of the frame as well as fitting deeper inside the helmet. Fox has
also made sure that the Vue Dvide Goggles provide you with an extended
peripheral vision and offer the widest field of vision possible. The Vue
features an injected Polycarbonate lens that provides superior optical clarity
and gives an increased level of impact protection. These goggles have an
outrigger design for an optimal fit and a 45mm elastic strap with a silicone
grip stripe secures the goggles to your helmet. For the finishing touches, the
Vue Dvide has a triple-layer face foam to wick away moisture before it gets to
the lens.
