## MARIN FOUR CORNERS BIKE 2021

### ON THE BORDER OF ADVENTURE

If you're the type of rider that loves touring, bikepacking, or going on an
adventure while riding on two wheels, then you'll want a bike that is highly
versatile and has the ability to carry all your gear with ease. The Marin Four
Corners Bike is built for touring, bikepacking, and dedicated commuting. The
Utilitour Double Butted CrMo Steel frame has rack and fender mounts so you can
carry all your gear with ease and ride in wet conditions without getting
splashed. The steel fork has fender, rack, and bottle cage eyelets as well.
The frames also come sized to fit people from 4'11" to 6'4" without
compromise.

The Four Corners comes with a Shimano Sora 3x9-speed drivetrain. The gearing
is made for a wide variety of riding conditions so you can ride longer
distances, climb easily, and cruise on the flats while you're loaded down with
gear. Tektro Spyre-C Road Mechanical Disc Brakes provide excellent stopping
power and work well in dirt and wet conditions. With the WTB Resolute tires,
you'll have enhanced puncture protection so you can ride with confidence.
