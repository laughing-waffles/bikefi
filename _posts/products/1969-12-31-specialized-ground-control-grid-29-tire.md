### REVIEWS

Bike Radar \- _"The new Ground Control largely lives up to its storied
namesake. We expect riders living in areas with even moderately tacky dirt
will probably be happy with it mounted either front or rear, but those in more
desert-like climes might want to restrict it to rear use._ \- James Huang
