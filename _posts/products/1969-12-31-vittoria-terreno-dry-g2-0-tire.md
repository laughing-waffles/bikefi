## VITTORIA TERRENO DRY G2.0 TIRE

### FAST ROLLING AND ULTIMATE PERFORMANCE

When you're riding in the dirt, the type of tire you use has a huge impact on
your riding performance. Tires with less aggressive knobs will perform better
on hardpack dirt surfaces while deeper knobbed tires will perform better in
loose conditions. The Vittoria Terreno Dry G2.0 Tires have ramped center
scales that provide a fast rolling leading edge and has sharp, responsive
braking and cornering edges. The tire is made with a Graphene 2.0 compound
that delivers excellent performance and the 3C compound in the tread increases
the wear life so you can ride longer in between tire changes. So if you're
looking to do a lot of riding on mixed terrain, gravel, or hardpack trails,
then you'll love the Vittoria Terreno Dry G2.0 Tires.
