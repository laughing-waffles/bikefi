## Pearl Izumi Transfer Mesh SS Base

### Start off with a strong foundation

A critical component to a high performance cycling kit, a high quality
moisture-wicking baselayer does wonders for improving the versatility of your
riding apparel. The Pearl Izumi Transfer Mesh SS Base is constructed from PRO
Transfer Mesh fabric with sweat-activated In-R-Cool® technology, to wick away
moisture and to keep you dry and comfortable. The form fit keeps the baselayer
snug against the body where it can wick away moisture most effectively.
Bluesign-approved GoFresh™ Technology allows for multiple wears without
washing—if needed—while keeping the funk away. Whether you’re looking for a
wicking layer beneath your summer jersey, or a base layer for your winter kit,
look no further than the Transfer Mesh Base.

### Features

  * **PRO Transfer Mesh fabric** has excellent breathability and wicks away moisture
  * **GoFresh™ anti-odor Technology** keeps the base layer fresh, even after multiple rides
  * **In-R-Cool® technology** is sweat-activated to help you regulate your temperature
  * **Made from 64% recycled polyester** for a reduced environmental footprint
