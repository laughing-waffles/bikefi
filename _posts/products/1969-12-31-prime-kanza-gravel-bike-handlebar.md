<h2 class="from-description-field">Prime Kanza Gravel Bike Handlebar</h2> <p>This brilliant handlebar is designed for adventurous gravel rides as it gives you smooth and reliable steering performance. Equipped a rock-solid 6061 aluminium construction, this versatile warrior is perfect for guiding you across mixed terrain conditions. Engineered for maximum control, Prime has also kitted this model out with a 16° flared-drop which creates a wider, more stable platform for excellent handling on tricky descents.  </p><h3>Lightweight Gravel Handlebar</h3><p>Developed to take you further than before, this mixed terrain conqueror weighs in at only 330g (420mm version). This means you can enjoy its tremendous strength without worrying about adding any unnecessary grams to your ride. Taking you from the city streets to the rocky forest pathways, its 31.8mm bar diameter adds another layer of durability to this already robust workhorse. </p><h3>Features:</h3><ul> <li><strong>Material:</strong> 6061 Aluminium</li>  <li><strong>Use:</strong> Road, Gravel</li>  <li><strong>Diameter:</strong> 31.8mm</li>   <li><strong>Drop Flare:</strong> 16°</li>   <li><strong>Rise:</strong> 20mm</li>   <li><strong>Bar Drop:</strong> 125mm</li>  <li><strong>Bar Reach:</strong> 75mm</li>  <li><strong>Weight:</strong> 330g (420mm version)</li></ul><p class="from-description-field">Buy <strong>Prime Components</strong> from Chain Reaction Cycles, the World's Largest Online Bike Store.</p>
