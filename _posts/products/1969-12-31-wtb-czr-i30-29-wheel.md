## WTB CZR i30 29 Wheel

### No Nonsense Reliability meets Carbon Performance

WTB’s CZR i30 wheels are designed to handle the toughest of trails and demands
of modern day mountain bikers. The lightweight carbon rim features a
strategically reinforced carbon layup and reinforced spoke beds to ensure
maximum strength. The hookless rim design paired with a modern 30mm internal
rim width allows riders to run modern tire widths at even lower tire pressures
for improved traction and comfort. Wrapped around the CZR rims is WTB’s own
tubeless rim tape and a nylon strip. The nylon strip helps to make mounting
tires easier and protects the rim tape from punctures caused by broken spokes.
As for the hubs, WTB went with a set of their reliable and high engagement
Frequency hubs. Inside of the Frequency hubs you’ll find heavy duty pawl
springs that engage with greater force to help counteract any torque caused by
uneven pedaling on steep and uneven trails. Lacing the hubs to the CZR rims is
a 3-cross style lacing and brass nipples for increased durability and
longevity. The CZR i30 wheels are a great choice for a variety of riders due
to their sturdy hookless CZR rims, fast engaging Frequency hubs, sturdy spoke
and nipple choice, and no questions asked rim replacement policy.
