## ENVE SES 3.4 DISC WHEELSET

### A CLIMBING WHEEL WITH AN AERO ADVANTAGE

Carbon wheels are one of the best upgrades you can do for your road bike.
Carbon fiber is lighter and stiffer than aluminum with enhanced durability.
Not all wheels are designed the same though, with some wheels designed for
top-end speed and some wheels built for climbing. The ENVE SES Disc 3.4
Wheelset is designed for climbing and has an aerodynamic advantage. The rims
are 38mm deep on the front and 42mm deep on the rear. This means you'll be
able to cut through the wind better on those long stretches. The 21mm inner
rim width works well with 23mm to 28mm tires. The rims are tubeless-ready and
come with 2 valve stems, 1 roll of tape good for 3 wheels, and 2 pressure
relief valve stem nuts.

### Features

  * **38mm rim depth on the front** and 42mm rim depth on the rear
  * **21mm inner rim width** works best with 23mm to 28mm tires
  * **Carbon rim** that is incredibly lightweight and highly durable
  * **Tubeless-ready** for a smoother ride and fewer flats
