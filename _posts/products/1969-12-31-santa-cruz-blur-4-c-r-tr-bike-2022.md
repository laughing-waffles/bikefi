## Santa Cruz Blur 4 C R TR Bike 2022

### The Aggressive XC Rider

When it comes to aggressive cross-country riding, you'll want a bike that is
both lightweight and highly durable. Cross-country bikes are perfect for
climbing, sprinting, and descending with confidence. The Santa Cruz Blur 4 C R
TR Bike is a more aggressive version of the Blur with longer travel. It has a
Carbon C frame with 120mm of travel on the front and 115mm of travel on the
rear. The frame features a spot for two water bottles, a chain guide,
Superlight Suspension System, internal cable routing, and a threaded bottom
bracket.

The R version of the Santa Cruz Blur 4 C TR comes with a SRAM NX Eagle
12-speed drivetrain. This includes a cassette that has a hill-crushing 11-50T
gear range that makes climbing and pedaling through demanding terrain much
easier. SRAM Level T hydraulic disc brakes provide excellent stopping power so
you can descend under control. RaceFace AR Offset 27 wheels are paired with
Maxxis Rekon Race tires that can be set up tubeless for a smoother ride,
better traction, and fewer flats. With the SDG Tellis Dropper Post, you'll be
able to quickly lift and lower your saddle with the press of a lever.
