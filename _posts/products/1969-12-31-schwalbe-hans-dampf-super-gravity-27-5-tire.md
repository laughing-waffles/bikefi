## Schwalbe Hans Dampf Super Gravity 27.5 tire

The Schwalbe Hans Dampf Super Gravity Tire is a terrific all-mountain style
tire that has received a massive upgrade in the form of Schwalbe’s new Super
Gravity casing. It features moderately-large center blocks in a unique
alternating tread pattern. The Hans Dampf throws down loads of traction in
various terrains and it’s large shoulder lugs provide excellent cornering
abilities. Schwalbe’s Super Gravity casing features an excellent balance of
protection, durability and low rolling resistance of all Schwalbe Super
casings. The Super Gravity casing is beefy, with a 4-ply casing enhanced with
Apex and Snake Skin protection makes for a tire that’s durable yet isn’t
overly done or too bulky. The Addix Soft compound has low rebound properties
and offers a great medium between grip and low rolling resistance. With
Schwalbe’s TL Easy technology, you can easily mount up the Hans Dampf’s to
your favorite rims and run them at lower pressures for increased traction and
control.

### Features

  * **Addix Soft compound** Schwalbe’s second most grippiest compound. Loads of grip and slow rebound properties without adding too much rolling resistance

  * **Snake Skin** provides bead-to-bead cut resistance
