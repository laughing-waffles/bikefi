## Galfer Wave® Disc Brake Rotor

Diligently made in Spain, the Wave® Disc Rotor is Galfer's research and
development at its' best. Each rotor is laser cut and double-disc ground from
high carbon stainless steel for powerful, progressive and modular braking in

high carbon stainless steel to increase longevity. The Wave's high temperature
resistance properties ensure stopping performance when repetitive braking is
required. Galfer offers the Wave® in different rotor sizes depending on the
discipline from Cross-Country, Enduro, Downhill to Cyclocross.
