## Cane Creek Hellbender 110 Bottom Bracket

The gold standard in bottom brackets has arrived. The Cane Creek Hellbender
110 Bottom Bracket is Cane Creek’s newest and best bottom bracket to date and
has been significantly upgraded in comparison to its older sibling, the
Hellbender 70. First up on the list of improvements, Cane Creek decided to go
with XD-15 nitrogen-infused, stainless-steel races for superior corrosion
resistance and strength. Next, Silicon Nitride ceramic ball bearings were used
for their improved heat resistance, extreme hardness and ultra-low weight in
comparison to stainless steel ball bearings. Surrounding the bearings, Cane
Creek decided to throw in some premium Kluber NBU52 grease, which runs
smoother and is more resistant to being washed out than traditional grease.
Finally, to keep everything clean and running smoothly, Enduro VV Type seals
were used for their dual-lip configuration, which helps block and keep out
dirt and contaminants.

### Features

  * **Silicon nitride ceramic ball bearings** 60% lighter and 7 times harder than steel. 8 times more heat resistance than steel bearings
  * **XD-15 Nitrogen-infused, stainless steel races** excellent corrosion resistance and strength
  * **Kluber NBU52 grease** high-performance grease than runs smoothly and doesn’t get washed out.
  * **Enduro VV seals** dual-lip configuration blocks out dirt and contaminants
  * **Cane Creek lifetime guarantee**
