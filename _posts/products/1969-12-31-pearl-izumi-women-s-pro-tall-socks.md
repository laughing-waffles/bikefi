## Pearl Izumi W Pro Tall Socks

The Pearl Izumi W Pro Tall Socks are constructed with recycled yarn that’s 3D
printed to reduce its bulk while maintaining a solid color penetration
throughout the sock, so that the colors don’t fade when the sock is stretched.
Thanks to the PI Dry® treatment these socks not only keep your feet drier on a
damp day, it also means that white socks are highly stain-resistant. This
might be the highest-tech sock on the market.

### Features

  * **Repreve® XS Polyester body yarns** made from discarded water bottles
  * **Mid-foot Lycra® powerband** provides support and keeps sock in place
  * **Seamless toe design** minimizes potential irritation in snug fitting cycling shoes
  * **Mesh over forefoot** helps keep hot-foot at bay
