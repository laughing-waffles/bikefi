## WTB Proterra Light i25 650 Wheel

### The no nonsense reliable option

WTB’s Proterra Light i25 650b wheels are a terrific choice for adventure and
gravel riders in search of a reliable and dependable 650b wheelset. For the
rims, WTB went with a 6069 series aluminum construction. This material choice
improves the rim strength as well as it adds vertical compliance, resulting in
a more comfortable ride than a 7000 series aluminum. Not to mention that the
6069 aluminum choice keeps the rims reasonably light while also retaining the
full rim strength. At the heart of the rims is a 25mm internal rim width,
which is ideal for most common high volume 650b tire widths and adequately
supports the wider tire width typically found on 650b tires. Wrapped around
the rims are WTB’s own TCS tubeless tape and a solid nylon strip. The nylon
strip makes seating and mounting tubeless tires far easier while also
preventing broken spokes from piercing the tubeless tape in the event of a
broken spoke. As for spokes and nipples, WTB went with a 3-cross lacing
pattern for reliability and alloy nipples for weight savings, a great balance
overall of reliability and weight savings. If we direct our attention to the
hubs we’ll find WTB’s smooth rolling Frequency hubs which offer a snappy
5-degree engagement, ensuring you’re able to accelerate as fast as possible.

  * **6069 aluminum rims** won’t beat you up, are plenty of strong, and reasonably light

  * **Frequency hubs** are reliable and offer a snappy 5-degree engagement
