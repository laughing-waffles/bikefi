## SPECIALIZED S-WORKS Turbo Rapidair 2Bliss

The type of tire you use on your road bike can improve or hinder your
performance while riding. The Specialized S-Works Turbo RapidAir Tire is a
high-performance road tire that is fast, lightweight, and supple. The Turbo
RapidAir rolls faster than a tubular and it has a low rolling resistance and
superior cornering traction. "Our goal was not to develop a tubeless tire, but
a tire that is faster, more comfortable, better handling, and self-sealing." -
Wolf Vorm Walde, Director of Tires and Tubes at Specialized.
