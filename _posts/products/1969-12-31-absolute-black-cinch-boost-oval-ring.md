## Absolute Black Cinch Boost Oval Ring

The Absolute Black Cinch Boost Oval Ring is ready to rip it up with its
beautifully machined, lightweight and stiff construction. Simply put, this is
the best looking spiderless ring we've ever seen. Its special direct mount
interface is compatible with Race Face Cinch cranks. The spiderless setup is
super clean and saves a great deal of weight over a normal spidered setup.
Oval rings spin smoother and promote optimal power transfer, eliminating dead
spots in the pedal stroke. The Cinch Boost Oval ring has Absolute Black's
specialized narrow-wide tooth profile which retains the chain snugly,
preventing dreaded chain droppage. Perfect for single ring or singlespeed use.

### Features

  * Oval rings help the rider spin smoother and generate more power
  * Replaces the existing chainring and spider on 3-bolt GXP cranks
  * Narrow wide tooth profile keeps the chain snug, allowing you to leave the chainguide behind
  * Fits Race Face Cinch Cranks
  * Works with 1x9/10/11sp or single speed setups
  * Designed in UK, manufactured in Poland
