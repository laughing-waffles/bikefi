## 45NRTH Gravdal 700 x 38 Studded Tire

### WINTER RIDING EVOLVED

Here's a no-compromise studded tire to take on your most extreme wintertime
conditions. It's the 45NRTH Gravdal 700 x 38 Studded Tire, a tire offering 252
studs between you and the ice below. And with the large 38mm casing, you'll
experience a level of confidence and safety never before seen in these
conditions. The strategically-placed center knobs are designed with siping, or
a process that creates tiny grooves to offer more flexibility for surface
undulations, for enhanced acceleration, braking, and corning traction, yet
also a more comfortable ride. It's just like those little lines on your all-
season car tires. Run maximum air pressure on nicer days, run closer to
minimum pressure when the weather turns. This extreme-conditions tire works on
many cyclocross and commuter bikes with cantilever or disc brakes.

### FEATURES

  * **Ideal tire** for winter riding on your cyclocross or all-road rig
  * **5mm high-visibility strip on the sidewall** for night visibility and safety
  * **Steel carbide studs** enhance traction in icy conditions
