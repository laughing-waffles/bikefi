## Easton EC70 Aero Road Handlebar

### Comfort and Speed

The EC70 Aero carbon road bars are similar to the EC90 Aero but features a
deeper drop, longer reach, and employs Easton's second tier carbon fiber to
create a more affordable carbon handlebar option. While still remaining
extremely strong and lightweight, the EC70 Aero road bars sport flat tops for
added comfort while climbing or just cruising along and an ergonomic bend
giving a low, aerodynamic position for sprints or time trialing. Easton's
combined their EC70 carbon fiber and Taperwall technology with the Intelligent
Flexibility design to create a bar that is stiff and efficient when sprinting
yet provides a smooth and comfortable ride for spending all day in the saddle.
