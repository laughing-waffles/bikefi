## Maxxis Highroller II 27.5+ x 2.8 Tire

Revamp your 27.5+ Trail machine with the open and aggressive tread design of
the High Roller II. With excellent soil penetration and mud clearing capacity,
the square profile provides a solid, consistent feel across the knobs.
Modified knobs on the shoulder and center, progress braking performance and
traction on hard surfaces. Employing Maxxis's EXO Protection, the High Roller
II is cut-resistant and abrasion-resistant on the sidewalls, while remaining
flexible. The 3C MaxxTerra offers a comfortable combination of traction, low
rolling-resistance and longevity. This is a large, high-volume casing that
still remains fairly light thanks to the foldable bead, making the High Roller
II ideal for some freeriding on long-travel 5" and 6" trail bikes. You fell in
love with it on your old 26" bike and have run it on each bike since, now
crush everything in your path with the new plus-sized High Roller II.

### Features

  * **Paddle-like center knobs** lower rolling resistance while still maintaining grip
  * **Aggressive side knobs** for cornering
  * **EXO protection** sidewall cut and abrasion resistance
  * **3C MaxxTerra** Maxxis’s middle-of-the-line 3C compound that specializes in both grip and low rolling-resistance
  * **Dual Compound** two rubber compounds for more longevity
