## MARIN KENTFIELD 2 ST BIKE 2021

### COMFORTABLE TRANSPORT

More and more each day, people are choosing to leave their vehicles behind at

coffee shop. It features a 6061 aluminum frame that has fender and rack mounts
so you can easily carry your gear and ride in wet conditions without getting

The Marin Kentfield 2 comes with a 10-speed MicroSHIFT drivetrain with an
ultra-wide-range 11-51T gear range that makes climbing much easier. Power CX7
