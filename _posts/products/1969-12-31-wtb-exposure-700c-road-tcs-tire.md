## WTB Exposure 700X30c Road TCS Tire

### Elite-level road meets renowned tubeless simplicity.

Go ahead. Steer that rig free of the pavement. Your hoops are wrapped in some
WTB Exposure tires. This tire has been specifically designed by WTB to perform
just like an elite road racing tire, but are also equipped to withstand the
rigors of the gravel and dirt sections that call to us once in a while. The
casing will be nice and smooth on the tarmac and hold its own in varied
conditions and the distance + compound will have you riding mile after mile
before needing to re-shoe your steed as they're formulated for maximum
lifespan.

### Features

  * **Distance + Compound** a harmonious pairing of longevity and traction.
  * **Supple Casing** delivers a smooth ride while also handling varied conditions.
  * **TCS (Tubeless Compatible System)** creates a consistent and reliable seal between tire and rim.
