## SRAM G2 ULTIMATE DISC BRAKE A2

### NOTHING HELD BACK

Going fast on the trails can be excited, but nothing is more important than
being able to stop quickly and under control. Hydraulic disc brakes provide
the best stopping power for your mountain bike. The SRAM G2 Ultimate Disc
Brake is one of the lightest four-piston hydraulic disc brakes ever. It
features more caliper stiffness and a new pad compound with bite and pivot
bearings for crisp lever feel and a fatigue-free ride. The G2 Ultimate has a
carbon lever and titanium hardware.

### Features

  * **Pivot bearings** for crisp lever feel and a fatigue-free ride
  * **4-piston caliper** for exceptionally stopping power
