## FABRIC LINE-S PRO TEAM SADDLE

### FINDING YOUR LINE

The type of saddle you use has a significant impact on your performance and
comfort. Unfortunately, saddles can be tough to navigate and many saddles that
feel great to other riders won't feel comfortable to you or your style of
riding. Make sure you always get sized before purchasing a saddle. The Fabric
Line-S Pro Team Saddle has a short nose that allows for a more aggressive,
aerodynamic riding position. It features a pressure relief channel that
provides all-day comfort, a wide rear width that provides additional
stability, and is tuned to deliver comfort for racing.

### Features

  * **Short nose** allows for a more aggressive, aerodynamic riding position
