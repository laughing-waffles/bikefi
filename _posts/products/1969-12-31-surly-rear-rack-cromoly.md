## Surly Nice Rack Cromoly

Surly Nice Racks are expedition-quality bicycle racks for extended touring,
camping, etc. The Surly Rack is made from high quality tubular cromoly steel
that is built to take abuse and carry a heavy load. Great for anything from
commuting to cross-continental globe trekking, the Surly Nice Rack is so much
more than "nice."

  * Incredibly strong chromoly steel construction (most cheap racks are aluminum).   

  * Chromoly means that in the unlikely event of a failure, you can likely find someone to weld it back together   

  * Powder coated for corrosion resistance 
  * Includes stainless steel hardware   

  * In general, these racks dont fit bikes with disc brakes or suspension, with the exception of Surly disc brake compatible bikes (Ogre, Troll, Disc Trucker). 
  * Front racks mount to forks with mid-blade eyelets - about 165mm from the dropout. Most quality touring forks have these. Hardware is included to help them fit forks without eyelets.
  * Rear racks are height-adjustable and has a wide platform to improve carry capacity
  * Front rack weight: 3lbs 13 oz (with mounting hardware)
  * Front rack load capacity: 70lbs
  * Rear rack weight: 2 lbs 9 oz (with mounting hardware)
  * Rear rack load capacity: 80lbs
