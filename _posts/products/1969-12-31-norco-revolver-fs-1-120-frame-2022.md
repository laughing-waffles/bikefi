## Norco Revolver FS 120 Frame 2022

### Your Ultimate High-Speed Machine

If you're looking to build up a bike that can climb, sprint, descend with
confidence, and handle technical terrain with ease, then you'll want to get a
trail frame. Trail bikes are more aggressive than cross-country bikes but less
aggressive than all-mountain and enduro bikes. This makes them perfectly
balanced for all-around riding. The Norco Revolver FS 120 Frame is the
ultimate high-speed machine that makes the most of every pedal stroke on
today's technical, physically demanding trails and racecourses. The frame is
made of hi-mod carbon and uses 120mm of travel on the front and rear. The
frame features internal cable routing, an integrated chain slap protector, a
place for a bottle cage, an FSA headset, and it comes with a RockShox SIDLuxe
Select+ rear shock.

### Features

  * **Hi-mod carbon frame** that is lightweight, durable, and stiff
  * **RockShox SIDLuxe Select+ rear shock** provides 120mm of ultra-smooth suspension travel
  * **Internal cable routing** keeps things looking clean
  * **Tire clearance** for up to 2.35"
