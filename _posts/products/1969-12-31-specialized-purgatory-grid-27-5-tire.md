## SPECIALIZED PURGATORY GRID 27.5" TIRE

### WAITING IN PURGATORY

Tires are not all made the same, and the type of tire you use on your bike has
a significant impact on your performance. When it comes to light trail tire
performance, the Specialized Purgatory GRID 27.5" Tire is the golden standard.
It has a new, completely redesigned tread that has square lugs that bite in on
soft soil while providing support on hardpack. Flexible center sipes fold out
under braking forces for increased ground contact and adhesion. With the GRID
casing, you'll have exceptional cut and flat protection at the sidewalls and
the GRIPTON compound helps round out the build making it a great choice for
trail riding.

### Features

  * **GRIPTON compound** rolls well and is perfect for epic trail rides
  * **2Bliss Ready** for a smoother ride, better traction, and fewer puncture flats
  * **GRID casing** provides enhanced sidewall cut protection
  * **Square lugs** bite in soft soil and provide support on hardpack
  * **Flexible center sipes** fold out under braking forces for increased ground contact and adhesion
