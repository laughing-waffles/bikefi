## ROVAL TERRA CLX 700C WHEEL

### ONE WHEEL TO RULE ALL ROADS

When you're riding offroad, you want to make sure you have a durable set of
wheels underneath you that can withstand the abuse. The Roval Terra CLX 700c
Wheel is road light and offroad tough. They are the lightest gravel wheels on
the market and have a 25mm inner width which makes them work well with 28 -
42c tires with up to 90 PSI. They are tubeless-ready so you can ditch the
tubes and drop the tire pressure for a smoother ride, better traction, and
fewer flats.

**Front Hub:** Roval AFD1, Centerlock, 12mm thru-axle end cap

**Rear Hub:** Roval AFD2, Centerlock, DT Swiss EXP internals, Shimano or SRAM
XDR (select option in drop-down menu), 142x12mm thru-axle end cap

### Features

  * **Carbon rim** that is lightweight and incredibly durable
  * **Tubeless-ready** for a smoother ride, better traction, and fewer flats
  * **25mm inner width** works well with 28 - 42c tires
  * **Includes:** Roval padded wheel bag, Roval tubeless rim tape, and valves
