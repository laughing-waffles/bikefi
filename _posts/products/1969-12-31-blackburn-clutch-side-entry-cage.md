## Blackburn Clutch Side Entry Cage

With suspension designs getting more complicated and top tubes getting lower,
the available water bottle space on frames has become smaller and smaller. A
side loading cage allows you to maximize your current allotted water bottle
space. The Blackburn Clutch Cage is an incredible side loading carbon cage
which is vigorously lab field tested to make sure it securely holds the bottle
no matter how bumpy it gets. The Clutch Cage is available in multiple colors
and left or right side loading options.

### Features

  * Designed for off road use
  * Right or left side bottle entry specific design
  * 30mm of vertical mounting adjustment
  * Made of rugged UD carbon fiber
  * 22 grams
  * Available in 4 colors
