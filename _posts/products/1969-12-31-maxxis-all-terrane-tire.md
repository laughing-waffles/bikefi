## Maxxis All Terrane Tire

Grab the hole shot and don't look back! The Maxxis All Terrane tire is a
cyclocross race tire designed to excel when the course gets loose, but it's
also ramped for speed on harder surfaces. The open tread pattern is quick to
disperse mud when you pick up speed and the tubeless ready design allows you
to drop pressures to get unreal traction. The cornering knobs dig in to give
you support so you can push your tires hard into any corner. EXO protection
fights off sidewall damage, so you can worry less about your tires and more
about winning races.
