## Chromag Contact Pedal

### Semenuk Design

The Contact's design features a lightweight compact platform body that extends
inboard bringing the riders feet closer to the cranks providing maximum
control when busting moves. The Contact pedal has a very low profile concave
CNC'd surface that is only 13mm at pedal center and weighs in at only 190g per
pedal. The pedal features removable pins with washers underneath so if you'd
like more grip, remove those washers and have extreme grip. Designed by the
best mountain biker in the world, Brandon Semenuk, you can't go wrong with the
Contact pedals.

### Features

  * 13mm thick at center creating a nice concave shape
  * 190g per pedal (380g for pair)
  * Sold as a pair
