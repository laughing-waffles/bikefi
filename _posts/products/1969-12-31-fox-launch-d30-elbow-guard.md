## Fox Launch D3O Elbow Guards

### Allowing you to shred with confidence

With each passing season, mountain biking technology progresses further by
making bikes lighter and faster and our equipment more capable, in return,
allowing us to ride faster and go bigger than ever before. However, this also
means accidents and crashes will be more prevalent, resulting in injuries. To
combat this, Fox partnered with D3O® to design safety equipment specifically
tailored to riders who love to shred the trails. Introducing the Fox Launch
D3O® Elbow Guards, a shredtastic combination of impact absorbing technology
and value focused design. Featuring D3O® inserts, the Launch Elbow Guard stays
flexible for ease of movement and comfort, but upon impact, instantly hardens
to dissipate the force of the crash. The slip-on, perforated neoprene guard
has a hook and loop adjuster for a tailored fit and is breathable and
moisture-wicking for all day comfort.

### Features

  * **D3O® inserts** For unbeatable protection.
  * **Safety** EN1621-1 Level 1 CE certification.
  * **Ergonomic fit** Pre-curved, slip-on fit with hook and loop adjuster.
