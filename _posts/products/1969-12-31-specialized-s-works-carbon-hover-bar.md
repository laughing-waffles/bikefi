## SPECIALIZED S-WORKS CARBON HOVER BAR

### CARBON HANDLEBAR THAT PROVIDES COMFORT AND PERFORMANCE

Handlebars are an important contact point on a bike that many riders overlook,
but when it comes to comfort and performance, it should be the first thing
looked at. Specialized has been making some of the best bicycle components for
many years and their S-Works level components are some of the most highly
sought after. The Specialized S-Works Carbon Hover Bar is a FACT carbon fiber
handlebar that excels in both comfort and performance. The FACT carbon fiber
is both lightweight and incredibly durable. The construction also helps with
vibration absorption. It features a 15mm rise and has a shallow drop and bend
which provides increased comfort.
