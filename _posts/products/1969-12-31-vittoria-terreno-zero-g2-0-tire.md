## VITTORIA TERRENO ZERO G2.0 TIRE

### FOR PAVED AND MIXED

Terrain isn't always so nice to riders, but there are occasions when the
conditions are perfect and the ride is simple. When you're riding on hardpack
and pavement, you don't need all the knobs that you would normally need when
you're riding in rougher terrain. The Vittoria Terreno Zero G2.0 Tire is a
gravel tire that is great for riding on the pavement and hardpack dirt. It
features a smooth center tread that reduces the rolling resistance and side
tread scales that grip well when braking and cornering in the dirt. It is
built with a Graphene 2.0 compound that performs well and the 3C compound in
the tread increases the wear life.

### Features

  * **Corsa-inspired smooth center** rolls fast on hardpack and pavement
  * **Side tread scales** provide cornering grip and braking grip
  * **Graphene 2.0 compound** provides excellent performance
