## Serfas FP-T3 Floor Pump

Every rider needs a reliable floor pump they can keep at their home. The
Serfas FP-T3 Floor Pump has a metal barrel and base and the handle has a

wide for additional stability and the hose length is extra-long for
convenience. A 2.5” analog pressure gauge makes reading pressures super-easy
and the pump and gauge have a maximum pressure of 160PSI. The valve head can
accommodate both Presta and Schrader valves and is stored on an integrated
hose keeper at the top of the pump.
