## Arundel Carbon Sideloader Cage

No matter what kind of steed you mount, keeping hydration close at hand should
never be a problem. The Arundel Sideloader provides a solution to cramped
spaces on compact style road frames, and awkward full-suspension mountain
frames. SideLoaders are for seat tube mount, right side entry. Being dedicated
as a right load only, instead of as a single flip-flop design, as some do,
would jeopardize proper bottle security. The full-carbon body keeps weight
down to a svelte 30 grams.

  * Material: Carbon Fiber 
  * Weight: 30 grams
