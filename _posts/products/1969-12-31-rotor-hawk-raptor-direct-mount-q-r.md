## Rotor Hawk & Raptor Direct Mount Q-Rings

Rotor meets the demands for smaller, lighter chain rings with the Rotor Direct
Mount Q-Ring. It is a simplified one-piece design that saves about 40 grams
compared to other standard set ups. The direct mount chain-rings are machined
from a single piece of aluminum, making them lighter and more rigid and
durable.

Rotor Q-Rings vary drivetrain resistance during a pedal rotation to align with
your leg's natural strength spots and weak spots to boost your overall
efficiency. In doing so, Q rings wisely utilize the strongest muscle groups to
increase positive work, while picking up the slack in the weaker zones to
reduce the negative work, potentially increasing a competitive cyclist's
performance by as much as 4 seconds per km in an all-out sprint. That may
sound miniscule, however it's twice the benefit of an aero wheelset, and in a
sport where a second can be the difference between the top step of the podium
and no podium at all; these proportions are substantial.

### Specs

  * 100% CNC-machined, 7075-T6 aluminum alloy
  * Semi-Aero design: reinforced rigidity and aerodynamics
  * Wide - narrow technology: Specially design for one ring
  * OCP Mount technology: Fine adjustment for OCP positions
  * Designed to work with all 9, 10 and 11 speed groupsets
  * Compatible with ROTOR RAWK & RAPTOR cranksets
  * Direct Mount configuration: Without spider and chainring bolts
