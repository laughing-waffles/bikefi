## Cane Creek Helm MK II Air 27.5" Fork

The Cane Creek Helm MK II Air 27.5" Fork is \ a revision of Cane Creekâ€™s Helm
fork lineup and improves on its predecessor in nearly every way. It features a
new compression and mid-valve circuit for increased support and control while
a new SKF oil seal head and 2.5 weight damper oil reduce friction and provide
a more supple ride-feel. The Helm MKII redesigned air spring has a new air
piston designed to reduce friction, an increased air volume for better
traction and suppleness, and a threadless seal head for easier travel change.
In addition to the updated damper and air spring, the HELM MKII features a
variety of external usability improvements including easier to turn knobs and
a D-LOC bolt-on axle.
