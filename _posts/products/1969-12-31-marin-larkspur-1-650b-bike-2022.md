## Marin Larkspur 1 650b Step-Thru Bike 2022

### Designed For Urban Commutes

Many people are choosing to leave their cars and trucks at home and taking
their bikes to work instead. If you're riding a bike to work, you'll want a
bike that is comfortable and is capable of hauling all of your essentials. The
Marin Larkspur 1 650b Bike is a steel-framed bike that is ready for any
adventure. Whether you're commuting, cruising the bike path, or you're riding
to your local coffee shop, the Larkspur will take you there. The Series 2
Butted CrMo frame has a step-thru design that makes it easy to mount and
dismount the bike. The frame also features rack and fender mounts so you can
easily transform this into your daily commuter.

The Larkspur 1 comes with a MicroSHIFT Advent 10-speed drivetrain. This
includes a cassette that has a hill-crushing 11-51T gear range that makes
climbing with all your gear much easier. Tektro hydraulic disc brakes provide
reliable stopping power so you can descend under control. With the Marin
aluminum double-wall rims paired with Vee Tire GPVee tires, you'll have
enhanced puncture protection and tires that work well on mixed terrain.
