## Shimano XTR FC-M9100-2 Cranks

### Get Ready For 12-Speed

Every few years, new standards will come out in the bike world. 11-speed
drivetrains took over the world with wider ranges and more capabilities. Now,
12-speed drivetrains are taking over with even wider ranges. The Shimano XTR
FC-M9100-2 Cranks features an entirely new construction, using direct mount
chainrings, a special gear tooth profile for improved chain retention, and a
narrow 162mm Q-factor.

### Features

  * **Smoother driving** even over bumpy terrain thanks to the special gear teeth profile design
  * **Lighter and stiffer design** and easily exchangeable chainring by direct mount and one key release
  * **Easily change between** single and double chainring setups with direct mount
