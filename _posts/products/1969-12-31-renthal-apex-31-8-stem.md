## Renthal Apex Stem

The Renthal Apex stem combines All-Mountain strength, Enduro stiffness, and XC
weight savings for a cockpit upgrade that can do it all. The Apex's unique
design incorporates a 240 degree handlebar clamp that allows much of the body
material to be removed, while still retaining the strength and stiffness
needed for wide, modern handlebars and the abuse of gutsy riding. The Renthal
Apex is fully CNC machined, featuring an oversized center bore, extensive 3D
machining, and external webbing that maximize the stems structural strength
and stiffness, all while maintaining an impressively low weight footprint. The
Renthal Apex is purpose-built to ride faster, jump further, and last longer
than the competition.
