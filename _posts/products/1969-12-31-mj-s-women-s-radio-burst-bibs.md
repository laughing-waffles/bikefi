The new Mellow Johnny's Women's Radio Burst Bibs feature the same fit and quality as our Classic Women's Shop Bibs. Made for us by Giordana in Italy with <span data-mce-fragment="1">elastic leg cuffs made with a soft and smooth Lycra and hold the bib in place without squeezing or restricting. And the bib straps are wide, soft, and stretchable microfiber and incorporate a micromesh fabric for breathability at the back of the bibs. The Women's Radio Burst bibs are finished off with our new fastback logo and a reflective tab on the back of the left leg for visibility and Giordana’s proven W Cirro chamois with aloe vera infusion. </span>
