## Fox DHX2 Factory 2021

### King of Coil

Everyone loves a well performing coil shock, as good as air suspension is,
nothing can quite compete with the way a coil shock stays glued to the ground.
The DHX2 offers consistently buttery smooth suspension and sophisticated
progressive damping. The recently redesigned chassis is sleeker and more
streamlined than ever before. The massive amount of available adjustments
including high/low-speed compression, high/low-speed rebound, and coil spring
preload allow you to perfectly dial in the DHX2 and optimize it to perform the
way you want it to. Increased oil flow improves damping control and
consistency while the recently redesigned seals keep friction to an absolute
minimum. The RVS damping system has been meticulously engineered to offer
reliable top of the line performance. Pair the DHX2 with a Fox SLS spring for
the ultimate setup. If you want the best in tunability and performance then
look no further than the DHX2.

### Features:

  * **New chassis** is more streamlined and sleek
  * **High/low-speed rebound, high/low-speed compression, and coil spring preload adjustments** allow you to fine tune the performance of the DHX2
  * **Redesigned damper** offers unmatched performance
  * **2-position lockout** for long climbs
  * **Ultra-low friction shaft finish** keeps the DHX2 buttery smooth
  * **Redesigned seals** keeps friction at an absolute minimum
  * **Pairs perfectly with the lightweight Fox SLS Spring**
