## Dakine Hip Pack

### Fanny packs have returned!

Whether your going for a light ride or using it for casual purposes, the
Dakine Hip pack is a perfect sidekick. This spruced up fanny pack features two
zippered pockets, with the front smaller pocket being fleece-lined so you can
stash you sunglasses. The Dri-mesh backpanel is lightly cushioned and
ventilated so you stay cooler on hot days and the waist belt is adjustable to
fit a wide range of waist sizes. Dakine designed all of their Hip Packs with a
Bluesign Approved woven polyester fabric and finished them off with a water-
resistant coating.
