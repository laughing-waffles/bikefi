## Finish Line Fiber Grip

Finsih Line Fiber Grip is specially designed to create friction and reduce
slippage between clamped carbon fiber surfaces. Carbon Fiber components have
torque specs which means you can't tighten them as tight as you want. Because
of this, it is possible for the components to slip. The Fiber Grip creates a
rougher surface so your carbon components don't slip. Apply Fiber Grip in a
thin film to clamping areas of stems, handlebars, seat posts, and seat tubes.

### Features

  * Eliminates the need to over tighten clamps to achieve secure connections
  * Tested and approved by leading carbon fiber component manufacturers
  * Available in a 1 pound tub or a 1.75 ounce tube
