## Specialized Eliminator Grid Gravity 2BR T7/T9 27.5" Tire

Designed for aggressive trail to enduro riding, the Eliminator GRID Gravity
features a well-balanced tread pattern, with large center blocks, smaller
transition knobs and large cornering blocks. GRID Gravity technology provides
enhanced sidewall protection from pinch flats as well as puncture protection,
in an ultra-durable gravity casing, so you can have confidence in rough
terrain. The Gripton T7 or T9 compounds provide excellent traction in various
terrains by using a rubber compound that is both grippy and has low rolling
resistance, with T9 being the grippiest compound. 2Bliss Ready technology
allows you to run your tires tubeless for less weight and more traction.
