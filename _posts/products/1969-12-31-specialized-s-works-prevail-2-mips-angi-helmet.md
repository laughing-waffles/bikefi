## SPECIALIZED S-WORKS PREVAIL 2 MIPS ANGI HELMET

### LIGHTWEIGHT ROAD HELMET WITH MIPS AND ANGI

It is not easy to improve on the best, but somehow Specialized was able to do
it with their new Specialized S-Works Prevail 2 MIPS Helmet. It features the
new ANGi Crash Sensor that detects crashes and alerts your emergency contacts
to let them know you crashed. With the ANGi system, the helmet includes a one-
year subscription to the Specialized Ride Premium app. It has a MIPS SL system
that is incredibly lightweight and ventilated. The ultra-light Mindset
HairPort II micro-dial fit system has height adjustability in makes it easy to
dial in the perfect fit. If you're the type of rider that runs warm, the 4th
Dimension Cooling System will keep you cool during those warmer rides.
Reflective decals increase visibility in low-light conditions and the Gutter
Action brow pad provides sweat management and comfort. If you're looking for
the lightest and most ventilated road helmet, then you'll love the Specialized
S-Works Prevail 2 MIPS Helmet.

### REVIEWS

PinkBike Innovation of the Year \- _"It doesn't make crashing any less likely
(that'd would really be innovative), but it is a tool that has the potential
to help reduce the time it takes to locate an injured rider."_ \- Paul Aston

BikeRadar \- _"No one likes crashing, but if it does happen you want to know
you’ve got the best protection possible for your brain. That’s the rationale
behind the new tech features that Specialized has incorporated into some of
its most popular road and mountain bike helmets for 2019."_ \- Aoife Glass

Bicycling.com \- _"ANGi can't stop crashes. But it's tiny, nearly invisible,
thing that, when you crash, can potentially get help to you sooner. Who
wouldn't want that?"_ \- Matt Phillips
