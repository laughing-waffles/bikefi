## Alpinestars Paragon Pro Elbow Protector

As knees are particularly vulnerable to injury, the Alpinestars Paragon Pro
Elbow Protector provides extremely lightweight, durable and flexible guard
constructed from breathable stretch mesh, which offers a comfortable and close
fit. The highly convenient and time-saving slip-on design with elasticated
cuffs and silicone printing prevents slippage and help keep protector securely
positioned. The flat inward-facing seam provides improved comfort and a
“second skin” feel and fit, allowing you to ride without any limitations to
your flexibility for as long as you want.

  * **Flat inward-facing seams** for improved comfort and ‘second skin’ feel and fit.
