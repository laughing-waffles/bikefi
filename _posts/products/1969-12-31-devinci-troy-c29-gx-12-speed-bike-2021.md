## Devinci Troy C29 GX 12-Speed Bike 2021

### One Bike, Zero Excuses

It's rare to find one bike that is good at many things. Some bikes can climb
exceptionally well but are tough to descend on. Some bikes can descend
confidently but take forever to climb on. The Devinci Troy C29 GX 12-Speed
Bike is a quiver killer. It features 140mm of travel on the rear and 150mm of
travel on the front. The Carbon DMC-G frame has double row linkage bearings
for precision movement and superior longevity, tire clearance for up to 2.6"
tires, a frame protector to shield the frame from rocks and debris, and a geo
adjust flip chip to customize the ride characteristics.

The GX version of the Devinci Troy C29 comes with a SRAM GX Eagle 12-speed
drivetrain. This includes a cassette that has a hill-crushing 10-52T gear
range that makes climbing and pedaling through rough terrain a breeze. SRAM
Code R 4-piston hydraulic disc brakes provide excellent stopping power so you
can descend with confidence. Race Face AR35 Offset wheels are paired with
Maxxis Minion tires that can be set up tubeless for a smoother ride, better
traction, and fewer flats. With the SDG Tellis Dropper Post, you'll be able to
quickly lift and lower your saddle with the press of a lever.
