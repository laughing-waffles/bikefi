## SPECIALIZED S-WORKS POWER SADDLE

### POWER TO THE RIDERS

For some riders, finding the right saddle can be difficult. No two saddles fit
the exact same which makes finding a perfect saddle even more difficult. There
is one saddle that comes close to being the perfect saddle though. The
Specialized S-Works Power Saddle is a premium-quality, ultra-lightweight
saddle that is designed for both men and women and both road riding and
mountain bike riding. It features FACT carbon fiber shell and rails and has a
pressure relief channel that helps reduce the pressure build up from sitting
on the saddle during long rides. It also has lightweight PU padding for more
comfort and support and SWAT compatibility which means riders can mount
integrated storage directly to their saddle.

**Note:** Oversized 7x9mm carbon rails are not compatible with seatposts
equipped with side-load clamp mechanisms for 7mm round rails.

you're already accustomed to firm padding, and don't tend to move around much,
