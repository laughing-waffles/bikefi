## Schwalbe Rock Razor Super Trail 27.5” Tire

The Schwalbe Rock Razor Super Trail 27.5” Tire was designed to rip up some
single-track and cut through rock gardens. The Rock Razor features small and
blocky center tread for super-low rolling resistance and large shoulder lugs
for excellent cornering ability. Outfitted with Schwalbe’s Super Trail casing,
the Rock Razor has a great balance of protection, durability and low rolling
resistance. The Super Trail casing is a midweight, 3-ply carcass layer
enhanced with Apex and SnakeSkin protection, making for a tire that’s durable
yet isn’t overly done or too bulky. Apex protection provides a layer of
sidewall cut protection and adds lateral stability and SnakeSkin protection
lays down a layer of bead-to-bead puncture protection, making for one tough
tire. The Addix SpeedGrip compound has the best balance of grip, durability
and low rolling resistance of all Schwalbe Addix compounds and is perfect for
cross-country, trail or all-mountain riding. With Schwalbe’s TL Easy
technology, you can leave the tubes behind and run your Rock Razor tubeless
for less weight and maximum traction.
