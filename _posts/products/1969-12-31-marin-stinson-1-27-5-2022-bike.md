## Marin Stinson 1 27.5" 2022 Bike

### Easy Cruising

Riding a bike isn't always about racing, shredding the gnar, or riding
hundreds of miles. Sometimes riding is about relaxation and escaping the
everyday grind. If you want to relax and ride the bike paths, then you'll want
a comfort bike. The Marin Stinson 1 27.5" Bike is an updated take on the
classic cruiser design for casual and comfortable path riding. It features
Comfort Control Geometry that allows riders to touch the ground with their
foot for confident and safe riding and stopping. The Stinson has a Series 1
Comfort 6061 aluminum frame that uses 27.5" wheels. The frame features a
kickstand mount, rack and fender mounts, and internal cable routing.

The Marin Stinson 1 comes with a Shimano 7-speed drivetrain. The gearing is
perfect for moderate inclines and fun rides on the bike paths. Power CX7
mechanical disc brakes provide reliable stopping power and work well in
various weather conditions. Marin aluminum double-wall rims are paired with
Vee Tire Co. Speedster tires that have puncture protection to help with thorns
and other road debris.
