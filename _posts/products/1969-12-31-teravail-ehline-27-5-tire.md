## Teravail Ehline 27.5" Tire

### Ready to flow

The Ehline tire was designed to conquer all the fast and flowy trails.
Teravail designed the tire to be fast rolling while still providing
uncompromised cornering performance. Boasting more traction and durability
than standard XC tires, the Ehline is perfect for riders who love fun fast
trails with technical sections in-between. The Ehline is available in either a
durable or light and supple construction in both a black or tan-wall colorway.

### Features

  * **Tire rolls fast in a straight line** and grips into every corner you encounter
  * **Two different construction options** allow you to choose either a light and supple tire or a strong and durable tire
  * **Durable casing** offers sidewall and under tread puncture protection
  * **Available with a black or tan-wall colorway**
