## Endura GV500 Reiver Bibshort

The Endura GV500 Reiver Bibshort is here to step up your comfort game. Made
with a high-stretch construction, the Endura GV500 Reiver Bibshort was
designed for maximum comfort and support on the trails. A 600-series pad
utilizes Endura’s Continuously Variable Profile (CVP), which uses stretch
materials and gel inserts for enhanced vibration dampening and support. The
super-stretchy main fabric allows for total range of motion and is breathable.
Double-layered leg panels provide additional durability and lumbar support
panels enhance comfort on longer rides. The GV500 Reiver Bibshorts can be worn
under shell shorts or just under a jersey and feature silicon grip stripes on
the rear of the bibshorts to help keep your shorts or jersey in place. Lastly,
integrated mesh cargo pockets and side waist storage allows you to take along
some small items on your ride
