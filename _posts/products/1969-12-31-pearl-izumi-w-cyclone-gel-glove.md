## Pearl Izumi W Cyclone Gel Glove

### She Moves Her Body Like A Cyclone

When the temperatures begin to drop, you'll want to wear your warm cycling
apparel so you can keep riding comfortably. Nothing is worse than cold hands,
but the Pearl Izumi W Cyclone Gel Gloves will keep you warm. They are made
with a three-layer softshell back of hand fabric that provides wind and water
protection. The palm uses Ax Suede Uno synthetic leather with 4-way stretch.
The gloves feature BioViz reflective elements to enhance visibility in low-
light conditions, hook and loop closures, and 3D-shaped gel pads that reduce
bulk and improve grip comfort.
