## Specialized S-Works Exos Road Shoes

### Light and Comfortable

At just a mere 150g, the Specialized S-Works Exos Road Shoes are the lightest
cycling shoes to ever come equipped with a Boa Closure system. They still come
with the sanem features that are synonymous with the S-Works label and still
at that sought-after world-tour level, except just ridiculously light. The
carbon outsole was developed using an advanced form of Finite Element Analysis
and pressure mapping to pull out material where it wasn’t needed, allowing
them to stay super stiff. For the upper Specialized used space-grade Dyneema®
mesh and some CubicTec reinforcement, with heel molds that hold your foot in
place. The use of a Warp Sleeve vamp allowed for the removal of the toe box,
further cutting down the weight and increasing comfort. The Specialized
S-Works Exos Road Shoes still retain the Body Geometry features that have been
ergonomically designed and scientifically tested to not only boost power but
also increase efficiency and to reduce the risk of injury.
