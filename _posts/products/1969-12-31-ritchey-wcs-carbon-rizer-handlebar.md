## Ritchey WCS Carbon Rizer Handlebar

Ritchey components have become well-known over the years for their reliable
performance and exceptionally quality. The Ritchey WCS Carbon Rizer Handlebar
holds true to that standard and is made from a premium carbon monocoque
construction and is reinforced on the ends of the bars to accommodate end
clamps and shifters. The WCS Carbon Rizer Handlebar features trail-specific
geometry and was designed for aggressive trail riding and cross-country
racing. To add the finishing touches, Ritchey added in a textured stem clamp
area to prevent bar slippage when things get a little rowdy.

### Features
