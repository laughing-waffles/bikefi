## SRAM Disc Brake Pads for Level and Elixer Brakes

### Replacement Brake Pads

Just like the brake pads in your vehicle, you need to replace the brake pads
on your bike. Whether you just cruise the bike paths or race to the podium,
your pads will wear out eventually. These SRAM Disc Brake Pads are replacement
pads for the Avid Elixir/SRAM Level hydraulic disc brake. They are designed
for use with Level, Level TL, Level T, Level Ultimate (B1, 2020+), Level TLM
(B1, 2020+), and Elixir.

### Features

  * **QTY "1" is enough pads for one wheel** and order "2" to replace the pads on one complete bicycle
  * **Steel back is most economical** and aluminum back is more expensive but saves weight
  * **Choose metal compound for maximum braking power (downhill/freeride use, larger rotors, bigger, more aggressive riders)** and organic for general, all-around use, most quiet operation
