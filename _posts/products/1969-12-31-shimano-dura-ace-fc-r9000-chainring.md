## Shimano Dura-Ace FC-9000 Chainring

The Shimano Dura-Ace 9000 Chainring fits the new 9000 series Dura-Ace crankset
which utilizes a 4 arm x-shaped spider and a 110 bolt circle diameter. Shimano
makes the 5th arm disappear, shaving some weight, yet still produced the
stiffest ring to date. The gain in stiffness comes from Shimano's Hollowglide
Technology and integrated chainring nuts make replacement a very simple task.
Chainrings are designed to work together as a set. For crisp and accurate
shifting, ensure you are purchasing the correct ring to match your specific
tooth count.
