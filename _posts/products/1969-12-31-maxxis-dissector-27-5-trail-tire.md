## Maxxis Dissector 27.5" Trail Tire

### Dissecting the trails

The Maxxis Dissector 27.5" Trail Tire is ideal for dry, fast trails. With a
tight-grouped center tread and ramped leading edges, the Dissector offers both
grip and low rolling resistance. Large side lugs allow you to corner at Mach
speed and siping on the tread adds traction and grip. All versions of the
Dissector are tubeless-ready so you can ditch the tubes and drop the tire
pressure for a smoother ride, better traction, and fewer flats. The Dissector
comes in a variety of sizes, casing options and rubber compounds so you can
find the perfect match for your riding style.

### Features

  * **Ramped tread** rolls smoother
  * **Tubeless-ready** for a smoother ride, better traction, and fewer flats
  * **3C MaxxTerra** Balance between grip and speed
  * **3C MaxxGrip** Maxxis's grippiest 3C compound
  * **EXO or EXO+** EXO is sidewall cut and abrasion resistance and EXO+ is upgraded sidewall cut and abrasion resistance as well as underneath the tread puncture protection.
  * **Double Down** 2-ply casing with 2 x120 TPI and reinforced sidewall protection (EXO)
