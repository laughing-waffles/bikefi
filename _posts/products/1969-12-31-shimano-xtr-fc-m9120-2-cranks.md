## Shimano XTR FC-M9120-2 Cranks

Shimano XTR series components appeal to the rider that is in search of the
most advanced mountain bike components to date. XTR is rider tuned and
available and built to suit the needs of the every rider. Shimano is inspired
by the versatility and capability of today's riders and the terrain they
tackle, XTR offers refined and tested solutions engineered for the way they
ride. From brakes to wheels, shifters and derailleurs, Shimano XTR offers a
full component line so you can build your complete dream bike with the best
components available.

Shimano didnâ€™t forget about those of us who prefer the awesome gear options
that can only be found in running a 2x system. In fact, the 2x system offers
an impressive gear range of 612%. With that kind of gearing you can climb
cliffs. The new Shimano XTR M9100 crankset is lighter, stiffer, and smoother.
It is all that you would expect from the next generation of XTR components. It
delivers optimal power transfer for maximum speed and efficiency.

### Features

  * **Direct mount large chainring** saves weight and increases durability
  * **DCE+ chain retention** keeps chain firmly connected to the chainring.
