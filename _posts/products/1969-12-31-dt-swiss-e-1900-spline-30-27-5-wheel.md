## DT Swiss E 1900 Spline 30 27 5 Wheel

### An affordable EWS ready wheelset

Modern Enduro riding has gotten gnarlier and more technical in the last few
years. Correspondingly, Enduro riders are demanding and needing more reliable
and durable components to keep up with them. Enter the DT Swiss E 1900
wheelset, it features a robust aluminum that’s designed to handle the toughest
of Enduro riding and racing, this truly is an EWS ready rim that’s ready to
tackle the most technical of trails. A 30mm wide internal rim width creates an
ideal platform for modern enduro tires. The tubeless ready rim design ensures
you’ll be able to run your favorite tubeless tires at lower pressures for
increased grip. At the heart of the E 1900 wheels are DT Swiss’s revamped 370
hubs. The 370 hubs are easy to service and maintain, ensuring they’ll run
smoothly for years to come. The big change this year is the addition of the
Ratchet LN system. The Ratchet LN system effectively brings DT Swiss’s
legendary ratchet system to the masses. Instead of the previously used pawl
design, the Ratchet LN system engages all ratches simultaneously, which
drastically increases the hub freehub longevity while also reducing overall
strain and stress on the entire freehub system. On top of that, the transition
to a ratchet system means that you can now easily upgrade the freehub
engagement if you want a faster engagement. Lacing the aluminum rims to the DT
Swiss 370 hubs are DT Swiss’s ever reliable 2.0mm DT Champion straightpull
spokes for maximum strength and resistance to radial forces caused by
drivetrain and braking torque. DT Swiss’s E 1900 wheels are the answer for
enduro riders in search carefully thought out bombproof wheels that don’t cost
an arm and a leg
