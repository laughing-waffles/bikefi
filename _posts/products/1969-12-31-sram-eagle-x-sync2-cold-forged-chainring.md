## SRAM EAGLE X-SYNC 2 COLD FORGED CHAINRING

Chainrings, chains and cassettes eventually wear out. When these parts wear
out, they will start to cause shifting problems and other performance issues.
The new X-Sync 2 Chainring design increases chain retention, wear life, and
reduces friction and noise. Eagle technology is the newest 12-speed drivetrain
system from SRAM and creates the smoothest, quietest, longest lasting and most
efficient drivetrains. The longer, positive-rake tooth shape has been designed
to work perfectly with the new Eagle chain to increase chain retention and
overall pedaling efficiency. A 3mm offset is for Boost spacing and 6mm is
standard, non-Boost spacing.

### Features

  * **X-Sync 2** increases chain retention and wear life
  * **Eagle technology** for 12 speed SRAM drivetrains
  * **Positive-rake tooth shape** increases chain retention and pedaling efficiency
