## Zipp Service Course 70-Ergo Handlebar

### Ergonomics meets bang-for-buck

Zipp’s service course 70 series is Zipp’s bang-for-buck level alloy
components, they offer excellent performance and features without costing an
arm and a leg. Zipp’s 70-Ergo handlebars are no different. Made of durable and
lightweight 6061 aluminum, the 70-Ergo bars keep weight low and are strong
enough to handle the rigours of crit racing, technical gravel riding, or even
a cyclocross race. The ergonomic top offers a more comfortable position, which
is perfect for longer rides where having multiple comfortable positions is
key. A 128mm drop puts you in an aerodynamic position without drastically
changing your hand position, resulting in increased comfort. The Zipp Service
Course 70-Ergo bars are perfect for any rider that wants to add a more
ergonomic handlebar position and wants a solid alloy handlebar that doesn’t
compromise on performance or features.
