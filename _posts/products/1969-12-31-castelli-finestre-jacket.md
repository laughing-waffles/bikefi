## Castelli Finestre Jacket

### Warmth for any ride

The Castelli Finestre Jacket is an excellent performer on any surface, in any
conditions. With Gore-Tex Infinium™ Windstopper® X-Fast fabric and a soft
brushed fleece interior on the upper front, back and arms, you are sure to
find comfort no matter how rough the terrain. X-Mid fabric insulates the lower
front and forearms of the Finestre and a breathable panel of Castelli Warmer
fabric at the back of the jacket lets hot air escape during hard efforts. The
silicone gripper at the waist keeps the jacket in place and eliminates those
pesky drafts, and three rear pockets allow you to bring as many snacks as
needed for an all-day epic. Exceptionally windproof, water-resistant,
breathable and lightweight. All roads, any conditions, the Finestre is ready
to take you there.
