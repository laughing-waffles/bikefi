## SPECIALIZED PATHFINDER PRO 700C

### IT'S TIME TO FIND YOUR PATH

When it comes to adventure on a bike, nothing beats riding gravel. Gravel
tires perform well on and off the road and just about wherever you want to
ride. The Specialized Pathfinder Pro 700C tire is all about finding the path
you want to take. It's a highly versatile tire that offers fast rolling,
exceptional grip in the dirt, and a lot of fun. It features the Gripton
compound and has an Endurant casing for added sidewall protection and
BlackBelt for flat protection. The tire is 2Bliss ready which means you can
turn them tubeless for an even smoother ride and better traction when you're
riding off-road. If you're looking for a great all around tire for your gravel
adventures, then you'll love the Specialized Pathfinder Pro 700C.

### REVIEWS

Bike Rumor \- _"The latest tire in SpecializedΓÇÖs adventure lineup is the
Pathfinder, and itΓÇÖs designed to bridge the gap between their very fast
rolling, minimally treaded Sawtooth and the knobbier (for a gravel tire)
Tracer. In fact, they say itΓÇÖs for rides when youΓÇÖre rolling on road and
off in roughly equal parts.ΓÇ¥_ \- Tyler Benedict
