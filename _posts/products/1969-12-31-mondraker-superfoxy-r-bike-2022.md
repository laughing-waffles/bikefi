## Mondraker SuperFoxy R Bike 2022

### The Enduro Machine

Enduro riders are all about the descents. With an enduro bike, you'll be able
to descend the steepest, rockiest, and sketchiest terrain with ease and still
climb back to the top to do it all over again. The Mondraker SuperFoxy R Bike
is a bike that many enduro and all-mountain riders will enjoy. It has a 6061
aluminum frame that uses 160mm of travel on the rear and 170mm of travel on
the front. The frame features Forward Geometry, SuperBoost 157 spacing, a
threaded bottom bracket, and Zero Suspension System that provides an ultra-
smooth and efficient ride.

The R version of the Mondraker SuperFoxy comes with a SRAM NX/SX Eagle
drivetrain. This includes a cassette that has a hill-crushing 11-50T gear
range that makes climbing and pedaling through rough terrain a breeze. SRAM
Code R hydraulic disc brakes provide excellent stopping power so you can
descend with confidence. Mavic Custom Deemax rims are paired with Maxxis tires
that can be set up tubeless for a smoother ride, better traction, and fewer
flats. With the OnOff Pija Dropper Post, you'll be able to quickly lift and
lower your saddle with the press of a lever.
