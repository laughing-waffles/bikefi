## Ritchey Comp ErgoMax Drop Handlebar

The Ritchey Comp ErgoMax Drop Handlebar enjoys a rich history of handlebar
design and development and combines it with the modern demands of discerning
riders who enjoy riding varying surfaces. It’s designed to enhance control and
comfort when riding along loose surfaces and is ideal for gravel riding since
it places the hands in a wider, more stable position while in the drops. The
Ergomax handlebar also features drops with a nice 12-degree flare to keep the
rider's hands in a comfortable and confident position, while also adding a bit
more unobstructed stability when turning or sprinting.
