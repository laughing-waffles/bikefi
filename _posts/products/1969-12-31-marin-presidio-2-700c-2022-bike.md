## Marin Presidio 2 700c Bike 2022

### The Dedicated Commuter

Whether you're commuting to work, cruising the bike paths, or you're just
riding to get some morning coffee, you'll want a comfortable bike to ride on.
The Marin Presidio 2 700c Bike is designed with low maintenance and
adaptability in mind. It has a Series 2 Commute butted and formed aluminum
frame and a lightweight aluminum fork. The frame features internal cable
routing, rack and fender mounts so you can easily transform this into your
daily commuter, disc brakes, and water bottle mounts.

The 2 version of the Marin Presidio comes with a Shimano Nexus 7D 7-speed
internal geared hub. The gearing is perfect for rides around the city and
commutes to work while your bike is loaded down with all your gear. Shimano
U300 flat-mount hydraulic disc brakes provide excellent stopping power so you
can descend with confidence and ride in wet conditions with ease. With the
Marin aluminum double-wall rims and the Vee Tire Baldy tires with puncture
protection, you'll be able to ride over rough patches of pavement with
confidence.
