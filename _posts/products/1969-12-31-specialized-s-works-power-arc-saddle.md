## SPECIALIZED S-WORKS POWER ARC SADDLE

### ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL SADDLES

Finding the right saddle can be difficult for some riders. If riders are on an
improperly sized saddle, they could experience soreness and numbness. There is
no such thing as the perfect saddle that fits everyone, but this one comes
pretty close. The Specialized S-Works Power Arc Saddle is a saddle designed
for both mountain biking and road biking and works well with both men and
women. It features a pressure relief channel that helps to reduce pressure and
has FACT carbon fiber shell and rails and lightweight EVA padding. The shape
of the Power saddle provides excellent sit bone support and the short nose is
perfect for riding in an aggressive position. The Arc version of the Power
saddle has a curved Body Geometry shape that better contours to your body.
This means riders will be more comfortable and will have increased performance
in the seated position.

### REVIEWS

La Velocita \- _"Simply put; yes, the Power Arc is a step forward. It feels
immediately familiar and superior to the old Power saddle… On the road, it’s
still a fantastically versatile seat. Sitting upright to climb offers a
comfortable platform for your sit bones… Comfort when seated at the front of
the saddle has improved too. The cut-out channel now starts further rearward
and the drop from the side padding into the channel has reduced."_ \- James
Raison
