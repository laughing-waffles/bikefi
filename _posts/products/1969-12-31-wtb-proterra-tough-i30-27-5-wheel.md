## WTB Proterra Tough i30 27.5 Wheel

### A No Nonsense Option

The Proterra Tough i30 wheelset is WTB’s hard hitting no nonsense wheelset
designed to meet the needs of modern trail and enduro riders. For the rims,
WTB went with a 6069 alloy construction for its optimized strength and
durability. WTB’s extensive testing showed that 6000-series alloy proved to be
more ding-resistant and offer a forgiving ride experience than 7000-series
aluminum, a win-win for trail and enduro riders. As for the internal rim
width, WTB went with a modern and reasonable 30mm internal rim width, which is
perfect for common tire widths in and around the 2.4-2.5” range. Wrapped
around the rims are WTB’s own solid nylon strip and tubeless tape. Unlike
other tubeless rim setups, the inclusion of the solid strip setup makes it
easier to mount tires and protects the system from punctures caused by broken
spokes. Unlike other similarly priced wheelsets, WTB focused more on
reliability rather than weight savings with their spoke and nipple choice. For
the Proterra Tough i30 wheelset, WTB ended up opting for a 3-cross lacing
pattern and brass nipples for increased strength and durability. At the heart
of the wheelset you’ll find a pair of Frequency hubs, which offer a rapid
5-degree freehub engagement, perfect for technical trails where inconsistent
pedaling is common. All in all, the Proterra Tough i30 wheelset is a
dependable trail and enduro wheelset that checks off and impressive number of
boxes without costing an arm and a leg.-
