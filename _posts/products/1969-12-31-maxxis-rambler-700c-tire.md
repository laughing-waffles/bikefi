## Maxxis Rambler 700C Tire

### Ramble on

Built for speed, control, and comfort, it is the go-to gravel and dirt road
racing tire. Purposefully built with a gravel-specific tread pattern of
tightly-packed and ramped center knobs for efficiency and low rolling-
resistance. Widely-spaced side knobs give predictable cornering
characteristics and the 38-45c width provides a comfort factor that will have
you exploring all day.

### Features

  * **Gravel-specific tread pattern**
  * **Dual Compound** two rubber compounds for enhanced longevity
  * **Large 38-45c width available** for comfort and traction
  * **EXO** sidewall cut and abraison-resistance
  * **Silkshield** under the tread and sidewall cut and abraison-resistance
