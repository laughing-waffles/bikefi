## Juliana Wilder 1 C R TR 29" Bike 2022

### Go Ride Wilder

Trail bikes are a great way to conquer the singletrack. They are great at
climbing, can accelerate on the flats, and descend like a champ. Trail bikes
are perfect for someone who wants a bike that is a little more aggressive and
capable than an XC bike. The Juliana Wilder 1 C R TR 29" Bike takes all the
acceleration and sprint qualities of a carbon XC bike and fuses them with a
rear-end that still rails corners like a hardcore trail bike. It has a Carbon
C frame that uses 120mm of travel on the front and 115mm of travel on the
rear. The frame features internal cable routing, integrated frame protection,
two bottle mounts, clearance for up to 2.4" tires, and a Superlight Suspension
System.

The R version of the Juliana Wilder C comes with a SRAM NX Eagle 12-speed
drivetrain. This includes a cassette that has a hill-crushing 11-50T gear
range that makes steeper hills feel much less steep. SRAM Level T hydraulic
disc brakes provide excellent stopping power so you can descend under control.
RaceFace AR Offset 27 29" Rims are paired with Maxxis Rekon Race tires that
can be set up tubeless for a smoother ride, better traction, and fewer flats.
With the SDG Tellis Dropper Post, you'll be able to quickly lift and lower
your saddle with the press of a lever.
