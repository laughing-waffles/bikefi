## INDUSTRY NINE Hydra Classic 28H Centerlock HUBs

### HAIL HYDRA!

In 2013, Industry Nine changed the landscape of top-spec wheel builds by
introducing the Torch Series, a hub driver with lightning quick 3 degrees of
engagement. Never a team to be satisfied with the status quo, I9 set to work
creating the next benchmark. After 2.5 years of planning, prototyping, and
testing in labs and the real-world trails of Asheville, Hydra rewrites the
rules with a monstrous leap to 690 points of engagement, or 0.52 degrees
between each engagement. Using an independently-phased six pawl, 115 tooth
drivering, Hydra’s drive system pushes the boundaries of hub technology to
achieve something monumental.

The trick behind Hydra’s insanely quick engagement is an innovative new design
utilizes a continually phased system, creating a procession of engagement
points between pawl and drivering. By utilizing the inherent flex of the axle,
I9 was able to create positive second, third, or fourth pawl contact for even
load force distribution. Another benefit of the Hydra design is its ability to
temper uncontrolled axle and bearing movements, thus improving bearing life
and decreasing resistance. Hydra provides a consistent, reliable engagement
without overloading bearings, axles, or hub shells.

Every Classic mountain hub is made start to finish in I9’s Asheville, NC
machine shop. From turning and milling bar stock 7075-T6 aluminum for shells,
axles and encaps, wire EDM cutting A2 tool steel for pawls and driverings, to
their own in-house anodization lab, every step of design, engineering,
manufacturing and assembly is done on premises to exacting standards.
