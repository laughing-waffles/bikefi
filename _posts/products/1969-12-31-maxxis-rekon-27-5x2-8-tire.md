## Maxxis Rekon+ 27.5X2.8" Tire

Introducing the Maxxis Rekon Plus Tire, a dirt tire that offers trail-
shredding capability without the bulky tread and excessive weight. The wide
knobs in the middle provide control under heavy braking and the L-shaped side
lugs allow for high-speed cornering. Silkshield provides an additional level
of protection for sidewalls as well as under the tread and EXO Protection
provides enhanced abrasion and cut resistance. Even with three additional
protective technologies and in a plus size tire, the Rekon weighs in at only
885 grams.

### Features

  * **3C MaxxTerra** Perfect blend of low rolling resistance and grip.
  * **Silkshield** Provides an additional level of protection for sidewalls as well as under the tread.
  * **120TPI** Gives better puncture, cut and abrasion resistance.
