## RockShox Reverb Stealth STD Remote C1

### Upping the game on droppers

The all-new Reverb Stealth dropper seatpost is paired with the STD remote to
provide you with low-lever-force hydraulic actuation. RockShox turned the
Reverb Stealth into a whole new animal with re-engineered internals. It was
put under a microscope and scrutinized right down to the tiniest seal.
Everything that could be updated and improved upon was and now passes even the
most brutal durability tests. The hydraulic system provides a smooth
transition between saddle heights. If you are looking for the highest
performance out of a dropper post, get a RS Reverb. The remote features
Bleeding Edge technology to ensure hassle-free maintenance.
