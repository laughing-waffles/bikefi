Rear hubs are more important than many riders realize. With smooth bearings
and enhanced engagement, your wheels will roll exceptionally better. The Spank
Hex Drive Boost Rear Hub features Spank's Hex Drive 102T technology that
delivers 3.5° engagement, for almost instant pickup. This means you can go
from coasting to pedaling faster with less lag time in between. It has 6
independent pawls with 3 steps per pawl that provide 18 engagement points per
click.
