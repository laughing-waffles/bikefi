## Lezyne Composite Side Loading Flow Cage

The Lezyne Flow Cage SL features a side loading design that allows easier
bottle removal from one side without compromising overall bottle grip. Makes
bottle access much easier in smaller compact frames. Lezyne uses a composite
matrix material and features ovalized mounting holes to adjust the placement
on the bike frame. Choose between left sided and right sided entry.

To elaborate a bit more, left side loading means that the bottle cage is
orientated so that the opening is on the left hand side. This makes grabbing
the bottle with your left hand much easier. This also applies to the right
hand version. On the right hand version the bottle cage is oriented so that
the opening is on the right side, thus making it easier to grasp and reload.

### Features

  * Composite matrix - 48g (claimed)
  * Side-loading design- left or right
