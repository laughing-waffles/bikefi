## Shimano Dura-Ace 9000 Shift Cable Set

This high-quality Shimano Dura-Ace road shift cable set is compatible with any
road group, including SRAM or Shimano. The OT-SP41 cables are entirely pre-
lubricated with a special silicone grease for quick and precise shifting every
time. By reducing inner cable friction, OT-SP41 shift cables are able to
provide a quick response with easy and effortless shifting, which prevents
power loss and shifting fatigue on those long, tedious rides. Arguably the
best shifter cable ever engineered for road use.

_Please Note: Not compatible with Campagnolo shifters._
