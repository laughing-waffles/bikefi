## Pearl Izumi Elevate Elbow Guards

### The gold standard for comfortable elbow protection

The Elevate Elbow Guards from Pearl Izumi combine supreme ride comfort with
high-level impact defense—perfect for days when medium weight padding is
needed, but pedaling comfort is critical. It all starts with the LP1
viscoelastic pads from D30®, a flexible pad system that provides exceptional
impact protection and breathability. The body of the Elevate Elbow Guards is
crafted with robust, 4-way stretch Cordura® fabric and a mesh inner arm
material to wick away moisture and encourage airflow. Who says you have to be
uncomfortable to be protected? The Elevate Elbow Guards are the perfect
compliment to your next enduro or trail ride.

### Features

  * **D30® LP1 viscoelastic padding** offers flexible, CE level 1 impact protection, with excellent breathability
  * **Four-way stretch Cordura® fabric** for durability and unhindered movement
  * **Mesh material** on the inner sleeve for added breathability
  * **All day comfort** for epic trail or enduro rides
