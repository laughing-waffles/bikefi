## Race Face Cinch Steel DM Chainring

The Race Face Cinch Steel DM Chainring is built to last, offering a hard-
wearing and corrosion resistant steel composition with a direct mount ring
that will last for years to come. Your chain will stay on thanks to the
narrow-wide chain tooth design, ensuring the ultimate chain retention. Itâ€™s
compatible with the Race Face Cinch system, which allows you to switch DM
chainrings with ease to compliment the type of riding you plan to do.

### Features

  * Narrow Wide tooth profiling ensures ultimate chain retention
  * Attaches as part of the RF Cinch system (using common Park BBT-22 bottom bracket tool) - allowing to switch between DM rings/spiders with ease
  * Hard-wearing steel with a corrosion inhibiting coating
  * Offers indentical chainlines to existing aluminum chainrings and can be "flipped"
  * Compatible for 9, 10, 11 and 12 speed.
