## SRAM S900 DIRECT MOUNT BRAKE CALIPER

Direct mount brakes provide a stronger and stiffer brake allowing you to
transfer more energy from the lever to the rim. Sliding into your DMs, or
direct mounts, is the SRAM S900 Direct Mount Brake Caliper. It is designed to
deliver great power and feel. The design reduces splay force and increases the
transfer of energy from the lever to the rim, making for a more solid brake
modulation.

### Features

  * **Direct mount road caliper** provides higher modulation
  * **Designed for short pull levers**
  * **Has clearance for up to 28c tires**
  * **Compatible with non-HRD SRAM road shift-brake and brake levers**
  * **Includes SwissStop Flash Pro pads**
