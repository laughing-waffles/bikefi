## Lezyne Composite Flow Cage Side Load Set

The Lezyne Flow Cage L/R Loading features a side loading design that allows
easier bottle removal from one side without compromising overall bottle grip.
Makes bottle access much easier in smaller compact frames. Lezyne uses a
composite matrix material and features ovalized mounting holes to adjust the
placement on the bike frame. Configure between left sided and right sided
entry depends on how you install cages. Illustration provided on packaging.

### Features

  * Side-loading design- left or right
  * Sold as a pair
  * Black or white
