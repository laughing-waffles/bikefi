## Chromag Trailmaster Saddle

### Medium firm, medium size

Perch yourself atop the Chromag Trailmaster and hit the trail for hours! The
multi-talented Trailmaster presents a medium-sized platform and a continuously
rounded perimeter that enables easy mobility without snagging. Medium-firm
density foam anatomically cushions the sit bones for long lasting comfort on
all day epics, while the thickened nose provides a reinforced springboard for
pedaling skyward. The Trailmaster's flat sitting area is divided by the
central relief channel that promotes proper blood flow in the perennial
region. To put a stamp on its authority over the trail, the Trailmaster is
swathed by a supple perforated natural leather top and Chromoly rails for
stiffness and resilience.
