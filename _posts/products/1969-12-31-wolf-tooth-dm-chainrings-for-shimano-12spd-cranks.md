## Wolf Tooth Shimano DM 12spd Chainring

Shimanoâ€™s new XTR 12-speed Hyperglide+ chain works a little differently than
any other chain on the market. In order to ensure perfect operation, Wolf
Tooth developed a completely new tooth profile to provide optimal chain
retention and durability when using the new chain technology.

### Features

  * The new HG+ chain interacts with the chainring much differently than a traditional wide/narrow design. Wolf Tooth engineers spent the time to understand how the system works and designed a new tooth profile that is optimized for this system.
  * Engineered proprietary tooth profile maintains the quiet and smooth performance of the HG+ drivetrain with legendary Wolf Tooth chain retention.
  * Prevents premature ring and chain wear that can come from non-optimized profiles.

### Specifications

  * Compatible with Shimano 12-speed Hyperglide+ chains
  * Compatible with Shimano Direct Mount cranksets
  * Material: 7075-T6 Aluminum
