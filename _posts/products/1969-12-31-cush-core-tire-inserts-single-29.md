## CUSHCORE TIRE INSERTS SINGLE 29”

CushCore is an engineered foam insert that mounts inside a mountain bike tire.
It divides the inner volume of the tire in half, with air underneath the tread
and the CushCore insert next to the rim.

The purpose of Cushcore is to improve the ride quality of your bike. It is not
just for flat protection. CushCore absorbs shock, stops deflection off
obstacles, reduces vibration, and stabilizes the tire against roll and squirm.
Think of it as suspension for your tires designed to give you a faster,
smoother ride.

This system is designed to be used with tubeless-ready or tubeless converted
mountain bike rims and tires. CushCore is compatible with tubeless tire
sealants.

*Single CushCore insert. 

### Features

  * **Compatible with** 29” wheels and tires.
  * **Provides protection** to both tire and rim.
  * **Improves ride quality** by acting as tire suspension.
