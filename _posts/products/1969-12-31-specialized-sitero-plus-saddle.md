## Specialized Sitero Plus Saddle

Next-level comfort for road warrior, endurance riders and time trial athletes.
The Specialized Sitero Plus Saddle is both super-comfortable and performance-
focused, incorporating comfort padding, a progressive shape and integrated
storage solutions to provide maximum comfort on long rides. On the exterior of
the saddle, Specialized used a perforated four-way stretch cover material so
you stay cool and comfortable all ride long. Next, the level-three
polyurethane padding cushions you pelvic bones, resulting in less fatigue and
more endurance when you are in for the long haul. The Sitero Plus features a
composite body and hollow Cr-Mo rails for a superior strength to weight ratio.
SWAT-compatible mounts on the underside of the saddle allow you to easily
store your gear for an innovative and aerodynamic design. The Sitero Plus also
includes an integrated Direct Mount Reserve Rack for extra storage options for
your water bottle and equipment.
