## Absolute Black Premium 2X 4-Bolt Oval Ring

### Achieve a Powerful and Consistent Cadence

The history of oval chain rings in cycling includes few less-than-successful
attempts. It's long since been understood that an oval chain ring could
theoretically enhance the power and consistency of a pedal stroke, but
previous attempts have caused gearing problems and even knee injuries. The
dream of making a functional oval ring was all but abandoned until Absolute
Black came along. The Premium Oval series has been meticulously engineered to
provide riders with power and consistency through their pedal stroke. The
shape is proven to eliminate dead spots and optimize power transfer. In the
process of creating an efficient performance ring, Absolute Black also
discovered that the oval design reduces peak loads on knee joints, therefore
providing a pedal stroke that's actually easier on your knees. By spreading
the load across a greater muscle mass, the Premium Oval rings keep you going
faster longer.
