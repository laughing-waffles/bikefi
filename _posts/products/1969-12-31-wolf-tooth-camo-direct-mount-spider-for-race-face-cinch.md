## Wolf Tooth Camo Spider for Race Face

### Bring Fast Chainring swaps to your Race Face Cinch cranks

The Wolf Tooth Camo Spider is the foundational part of an optimized chainline
system that includes a round or elliptical Camo Chainring. This setup is
designed for ease of access and quick maintenance so that you can swap out
different size and shape chainrings with minimal fuss. The CAMO Spider bolt
holes are threaded so you can swap out chainrings without messing with any
nuts and only unthreading five bolts. The CAMO Spider is only compatible with
Wolf Tooth CAMO round or elliptical chainrings and bolts. Black bolts are
included with the spider, but you can choose color-matched bolts and various
rings shapes and sizes to add your own personal flair to your ride.

### Features

  * **Offset options** allow you to dial in your chainline for whatever bike design you have
    * **M8** (minus 8mm - dished towards the frame) is for **standard 49mm chainline**. This is for use on bikes with 135mm QR, 142mm thru axle, and some 148mm bikes. 
    * **M5** (Boost - minus 5mm - dished towards the frame) is for **52mm chainline that Boost bikes may need**. _This link explaining 148mm "Boost" spacing_ will help you decide if you need the M5 or M8.
    * **P2** (plus 2mm - dished outwards away from the frame) is for **fat bikes that have 190/197 rear spacing but use a 100mm spindle**. This is now very common on production fat bikes to keep the q-factor slimmer
  * **Perfect chainline** setup increases durability and performance
  * **Material optimization** allows Wolf Tooth to keep weight to a minimum while increase strength and longevity.
  * **Fast chainring swaps** set you up to customize your drivetrain for the varying terrain you choose to ride
  * **Affordability** minimalistic use of materials not only means lightweight bike pieces, but also affordable replacement parts when you need them
