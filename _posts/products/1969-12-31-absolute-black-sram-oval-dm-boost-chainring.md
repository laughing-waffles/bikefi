## Absolute Black SRAM Oval DM Boost Chainring

Are you ready to set that next KOM? The Absolute Black Spiderless GXP Direct-
Mount Oval Ring is ready to rip it up with its beautifully machined,
lightweight, and stiff construction. Simply put, this is the best looking
spiderless ring we've ever seen. Its special direct mount interface is
compatible with SRAM GXP MTB cranks that feature removable spiders. Simply
remove your existing spider and bolt this ring on in its place. The spiderless
setup is super clean and saves a great deal of weight over a normal spidered
setup. Oval rings spin smoother and promote optimal power transfer,
eliminating dead spots in the pedal stroke. The Spiderless GXP Oval Ring has
AbsoluteBlack's specialized narrow-wide tooth profile which retains the chain
snugly, preventing dreaded chain droppage. Perfect for single ring or single
speed use.

### Features

  * Oval rings help the rider spin smoother and generate more power
  * Example: 32t is equivalent to 30t at dead spot and 34t at the power zone
  * Narrow-wide tooth profile keeps the chain snug, allowing you to leave the chain guide behind
  * Designed in UK, manufactured in Poland
