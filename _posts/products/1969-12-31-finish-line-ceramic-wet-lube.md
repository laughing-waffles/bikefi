Finish Line's Ceramix Wet Lube incorporates nan-sized platelets of ceramic
boron nitride and micron particles of flouropolymer. Essentially, that means
that it creates a lube with a very low coefficient of friction. In other
words, it keeps the surfaces that are rubbing together very slippery. This
keeps the drivetrain running smoothly and reduces friction, which in turn
increases the life of the components.

The Finish Line Ceramic Wet is a full waterproof lube that is very effective
for mountain bikes, road racing, cyclocross and track racing. Finish Line 1
Step and Lubricant features a Readily Biodegradable formulation which means
that more than 60% of the product's base oils will degrade within 28 days once
exposed to contact with common soil-borne bacterias.

**Note** \- The white ceramic particles may turn grey or black over time. This
discoloration is normal and will not compromise performance. After several
applications this will lessen.
