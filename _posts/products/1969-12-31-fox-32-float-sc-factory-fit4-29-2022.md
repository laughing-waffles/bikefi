## Fox 32 Float SC Factory FIT4 29 2022

### Podium Performance

The 32 Step Cast Factory fork is the ultimate cross-country fork, it’s been
designed with one goal in mind, to win. It’s been ridden on the biggest stages
in the world and piloted to UCI World Cup wins. Every gram of the 32 Step Cast
has been optimized to be as efficient as possible. The Step Cast lowers have
been engineered to save as much weight as possible without affecting the
fork’s overall stiffness. The Step Cast design has also allowed Fox’s
engineers to narrow the overall stance of the fork while simultaneously
increasing clearance for spokes and rotors. The recently redesigned crown has
increased the overall crown stiffness by 20%, bringing the crown stiffness
almost in line with the burlier Fox 34. Now in its fourth generation, the FIT4
damper is ready to deliver incredible performance with excellent high bump
sensitivity and support throughout the mid-stroke. The FIT4 damper features 22
clicks of low-speed compression adjustment, 10 clicks of low-speed rebound
adjustment, and three on-the-fly compression damping adjustments. This
incredible amount of adjustability allows you to dial in the 32 Step Cast’s
performance. The Fox Float EVOL Air Spring provides increased sensitivity and
traction by automatically equalizing the positive and negative air chambers.
Buttery smooth Kashima coating keeps the fork running like a dream and looks
pretty darn good.
