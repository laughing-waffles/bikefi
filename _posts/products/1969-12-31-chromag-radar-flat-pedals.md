## Chromag Radar Pedals

### The Grom's Gold Standard

The young guns are making their mark on mountain biking, and their level of
progression is shocking to say the least. Chromag, the notorious Whistler
based brand has decided to show the groms some love. Their Radar pedal
features a one of a kind platform, built specifically for smaller feet. By
adopting the same precision axle and bearing systems from their full size
Contact and Scarab models, Chromag scaled the size down to create a true
performance pedal for all the young trail slayers out there. A narrower
concave profile with 8 removable pins makes these pedals a serious pair of
foot-magnets. The axle and body are completely serviceable and re-buildable,
giving them extra durability.

### Features

  * Suggested age range: 4-10 years old
  * Compact 70x93mm platform
  * Lightweight assembly at 300g per pair
