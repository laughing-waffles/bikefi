## E*Thirteen Helix 42-50t Race Cluster

The E*thirteen Helix 42-50t Race Cluster is here to change the game. Featuring
more gear range than any other cassette on the market today, the E*Thirteen
Helix is a premium 12-speed cassette that has been split into two separate
clusters. This 42-50t cluster makes up the bottom two gears and when paired
with the separately sold, 9-36t Race Cluster, this cassette sports a 556% gear
range. The 42-50t Race Cluster is made out of aluminum for an ultra-
lightweight construction and is designed to work perfectly with SRAM and
Shimano 12-speed drivetrains. The two-piece design makes it easy to change and
replace the worn out gears without having to buy a whole new cassette.

### Features

  * **Lightweight** 345g for the complete cassette
  * **Made out of aluminum alloy**
  * **Needs to be paired with the** E*Thirteen Helix 9-36t race cluster to complete the cassette
