## VITTORIA REVOLUTION TECH G2.0 TIRE

### THE REVOLUTION HAS STARTED

When you're riding on rough roads and hardpack dirt surfaces, you need to have
tires underneath you that are able to withstand anything you throw at them.
The Vittoria Revolution Tech G2.0 Tire is built for city riding and beyond
with its tread design that rolls faster than a slick tire while also providing
traction in a range of conditions. It is built with additional puncture
protection to help reduce the number of flats and it has a reflective sidewall
stripe that increases the visibility in low-light conditions. The Graphene 2.0
compound in the tire reduces the rolling resistance so you can roll more
freely.

### Features

  * **Special tread design** performs well on and off the road
  * **Puncture protection layer** helps reduce the number of flats
  * **Reflective sidewall stripe** increases visibility in low-light conditions
