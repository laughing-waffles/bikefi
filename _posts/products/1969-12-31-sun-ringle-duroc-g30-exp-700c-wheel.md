## Sun Ringle Duroc G30 EXP 700c Wheel

### No nonsense do-it-all wheels

Sun Ringle’s Duroc G30 Expert wheels are an excellent choice for gravel and
adventure riders in search of a durable and affordable wheel that can handle
wide tires. The internal width of the rim measures in at a wide 26mm, making
the Duroc G30 Expert rims ideal for monster cross, adventure, or wide gravel
tires. Pair the 26mm internal rim width with the durable alloy rim's Duroc rim
technology and wide tubeless channel and you’ve got a set of wheels that’ll be
dead simple to set up tubeless. At the center of the rims you’ll find Sun
Ringle’s reliable SRX hubs. They feature a quick 12-degree engagement, which
comes in handy on rough and technical terrain or when you’re trying to snag
the lead at the startline.
