## EASTON EA70 AX 650B DISC WHEEL

Find the road less travelled on the new EA70 AX wheelset. Joining forces with
the EA70 and EC70 AX Bar in Easton’s AX adventure road line, the new EA70 AX
wheelset has the durability to withstand trail riding but is translated to
drop bar applications with center lock hubs and 11-speed road and 12x100 front
hub compatibility. From bikepacking adventures loaded with gear, to
washboarded gravel descents with only your wheels and tires providing the
compliance, Easton has you covered. The welded tubeless ready rim boasts a
generous 24mm internal rim width that increased tire volume and gives an
optimal tire profile for 35 to 50C tires. Available in 650b and 700c it’s the
perfect wheelset to round out any adventure drop bar build.

### Features

  * **Constructed from Easton EA70 Aluminum** for strength and lightweight.
  * **Tubeless ready rim** makes tubeless setup a snap.
  * **24mm internal width** takes full advantage of today’s larger volume tires.
  * **Center Lock hubs** for a lightweight and secure rotor interface.
