## Spank Spike 777 Bearclaw Vibrocore Handlebar

### The Claw Provides

When Spank Industries' set out to build the perfect freeride bar, they made
the executive decision to consult Freeride legend, Darren "Bearclaw"
Berrecloth. This epic collaboration of engineering savvy and mountainbiking
prowess yielded the Spike 777 FR Bearclaw Bar. A purpose developed 2 series
alloy paired with Spank Industries' patented Dual XGT butting process give the
Spike 777 FR Bearclaw an unmatched strength to weight ratio. The result is a
Freeride handlebar with unprecedented stiffness and durability at an
exceptionally low weight. It features Spike's Vibracore technology to dampen
vibration, preventing arm-pump and fatigue.

### Features

  * **Vibrocore foam core** provides vibration damping proven to reduce arm pump and hand-numbness
  * **Extreme gradual taper (XGT) technology** results in lighter, thinner walls without sacraficing durability
  * **Shot-peened and anodized** enhances fatigue life even further
