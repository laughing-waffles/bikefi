This is one-half of a complete headset (the upper portion only). You would
pair it with a seperate matching lower assembly sized to suit your frame/fork
to have a complete headset. Integrated-style 41mm or 42mm for integrated
(Campy-Style) headset top cups.  

  * Features high quality, black oxide sealed cartridge bearings
  * "Short" has a stack height of 8mm and "Tall" has a stack height of 15mm

_Stuck? Dont guess - use the excellentCane Creek Headset Fit Finder, or
contact Jenson USA for guidance._
