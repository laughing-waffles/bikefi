## 100% Speedcoupe Sunglasses

### Versatile speed

Borrowing the rubberized temple tips from the original 100% Speedcraft frame,
the Speedcoupe is 100%'s versatile, smaller-profile sunglass offering, ideal
for cycling and multisport use. The decentered 8-base spherical lens provides
the superior optical clarity that you have come to expect from 100%, while
being highly impact-resistant and offering a Hydroilo lens treatment to shed
water, dirt and oil. The lightweight and robust TR90 polycarbonate wrap-around
frame has built-in temple arm scoops to help moderate moisture, and a high-
grip nose piece to keep the Speedcoupe glasses in place, allowing you to go
fast no matter the sport.

### Features

  * **Optional HiPER lens** provides increased contrast and improved colors
  * **Decentered 8-base spherical lens** for clear and precise optics
  * **Impact and scratch-resistant lens** for exceptional durability
  * **Temple arm ventilation scoops** increase airflow to reduce moisture buildup
  * **High-grip rubber nose piece and temple tips** keep the Speedcoupes in place during the hardest rides
  * **Easily-interchangeable lenses** with a clear lens included
  * **100% UV protection (UV 400)** for safety and to reduce eye strain
