## Crank Brothers klic pump hp

The Crank Brothers Klic Pump HP clicks into action with all the features you
are looking for in a high quality, portable hand pump. This premium pump has a
flexible rubber hose that hides inside the body of the pump when not in use -
perfect for those stealth air-strikes! When it's time to inflate, just click
the hose into place, open up the folding handle and pump. The hose is

receive accurate pressure readings or the non-gauge version, and save some
weight. The high-pressure Klic pump is recommended for tires 45c or narrower.
