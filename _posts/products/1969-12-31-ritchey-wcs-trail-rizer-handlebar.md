## Ritchey WCS Trail Rizer Handlebar

Ritchey has been producing quality on and off-road biking components and
frames for over forty years. Ritchey handlebars are designed with performance
and reliability in mind, making for bars that are strong and lightweight. The
Ritchey WCS Trail Rizer Handlebar features 20-30mm of rise and is made from
7075 aluminum alloy. Ritchey’s WCS Trail technology provides a more trail-
oriented geometry by using 800mm wide bars that have 9-degree back sweep with
a slight, 2-degree upsweep. Weighing in at just 276 grams, the WCS Trail Rizer
Handlebar won’t weigh down the front of the bike, yet doesn’t sacrifice
strength.
