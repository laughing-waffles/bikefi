## Specialized Hillbilly Grid 29" Tire

Born in the dirt and mud, the Hillbilly is untamable and wild, knowing nothing
in life but to be tough and mean. Wherever the Hillbilly may roam, he searches
for loose and soft terrain, ready to get rowdy at the spin of a crank arm.

The Specialized Hillbilly GRID 29” Tire features aggressive and tall center
tread for getting through the slow stuff, provides loads of traction and digs
deep into loose sand. Large side knobs allow for stability during high-speed
cornering and the open design prevents mud build-up. Specialized’s GRID
technology provides enhanced sidewall protection from pinch flats as well as
bead-to-bead protection from punctures in lightweight trail casing. Gripton
rubber technology provides excellent traction and grip, dampens vibrations
from the trail and sports ultra-low rebound properties, keeping your tires
locked to the ground. The Hillbilly also features 2 Bliss Ready technology,
which allows you to run your tires tubeless for less weight and more traction.

### Features

  * **2Bliss Ready** butyl wrapped bead
  * **GRIPTON® compound** provides the optimal grip, traction and damping properties of all Gripton compounds.
  * **GRID** flat and sidewall protection for additional stability
