## Schwalbe Durano Plus 700C Tire

### Flat less, Ride Further

Schwalbe’s Durano Plus is designed to be the most puncture resistant road bike
tire available. It features a unique version of Schwalbe’s SmartGuard belt
which offers a massive amount of protection but without drastically affecting
the rolling resistance of the tire. With the Addix compound you’ll have plenty
of cornering grip so you can still rail turns with confidence. A folding bead
tire design makes tire installation and removal easy. If you’re done with
fixing flats on the side of the road but still want race level rolling
resistance and cornering performance then the Durano Plus is for you.

### Features

  * **SmartGuard belt** offers incredible flat protection
  * **Addix compound** provides excellent cornering grip and rolling resistance
  * **Folding bead** for easy tire installation and removal
  * **Protection design cues taken from the iconic Marathon Plus tire**
