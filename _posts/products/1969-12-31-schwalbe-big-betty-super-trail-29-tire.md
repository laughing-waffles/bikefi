## Schwalbe Big Betty Super Trail 29" Tire

The Schwalbe Big Betty is an mountain workhorse that excels on aggressive
trails. The Big Betty features long supported braking edges for maximum
braking traction and has large, stable shoulder blocks for outstanding
cornering grip. This tire is fitted with Schwalbe's new Super Trail casing,
which has a 3-ply carcass layer, Apex sidewall protection and a SnakeSkin
bead-to-bead protection. This version of the Big Betty is fitted with
Schwalbe’s Addix Soft Compound, which is a balanced rubber compound that is
grippy and has low rolling resistance. The Big Betty works perfectly on the
rear wheel and pairs well with the Schwalbe Magic Mary on the front wheel.
