## LEZYNE MINI DRIVE 400 LIGHT

### DRIVING OFF THE DARKNESS

Handlebar space can be incredibly limited, but you'll still need a light if
you're riding at night. The Lezyne Mini Drive 400 Light is a compact cycling
light with a machined aluminum body. It is bright and has a single LED that
provides up to 400 lumens. It has 8 output modes and cutouts for side
visibility so you can be visible from the sides at intersections. The
integrated USB stick makes it easy to charge without a cable. It's also
available in several different colors, so you can add a splash of style to
your ride.

### Features

  * **Machined aluminum body** is lightweight and durable
  * **Daytime Flash mode** so you can use this at all hours of the day
  * **Side cutouts** for increased visibility at intersections
