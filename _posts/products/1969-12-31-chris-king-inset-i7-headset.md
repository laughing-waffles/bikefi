## Chris King InSet 7 Headset

Chris King designed the first sealed bearing headset in 1976. Thirty-four
years later, Chris King headsets remain a benchmark for quality. No other
bicycle component can claim the precision, performance and absolute
reliability of a Chris King headset. At Chris King Precision Components, they
manufacture each headset in their own Portland, OR facility to the highest of
standards, using quality-at-the-source methods to minimize waste. Even the
sealed, cartridge style bearings are made in-house and are hand-checked.

InSet 7 is the classic, unbeatable Chris King sealed bearing headset built
into six configurations for contemporary bicycle headtube dimensions. As a
mixed style headset, the top press-in cup and bearings are housed within the
headtube allowing for an overall lower ride height, while the lower bearing
retains a traditional, external style. The InSet also features Chris King's
GripLock bearing cap design that uses a multi-piece bearing cap and a split
ring for improved steerer tube interface. We can guarantee that your Chris
King headset will last a lifetime and always offer reliable performance.
