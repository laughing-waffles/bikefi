fork lineup and improves on its predecessor in nearly every way. It features a
new compression and mid-valve circuit for increased support and control while
a new SKF oil seal head and 2.5 weight damper oil reduce friction and provide
a more supple ride-feel. The HELM MKII newly designed damper features a new
compression and mid-valve circuit for increased support and control while a
new SKF oil seal head and 2.5 weight damper oil reduce friction and provide a
more supple ride-feel. The HELM MKII features a variety of external usability
improvements including easier to turn knobs and a D-LOC bolt-on axle.
