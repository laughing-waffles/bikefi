## SPECIALIZED TRACER PRO 2BLISS 700C TIRE

The type of tire you use is important to how well your bike will perform in
any given terrain. It can hinder or increase your performance. The Specialized
Tracer Pro 2Bliss 700c Tire is designed for dry and intermediate conditions.
The tread of the Tracer Pro features a raised knob configuration in the center
of the tire and slightly higher shoulder knobs for better cornering. The tire
has the GRIPTON compound which keeps the tire soft and supple in cold
climates. This makes the tire perfect for gravel and adventure riding. It is
2Bliss ready which means riders can drop their tire pressure for a smoother
ride and better traction. If you're looking for a great all-around dirt tire,
then you'll love the Specialized Tracer Pro 2Bliss 700c Tire.
