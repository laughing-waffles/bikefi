## Specialized Renegade Control 2Bliss Ready T5 29" Tire

### Perfect For XC Riding

When it comes to your performance on your mountain bike, the tires you use
play a significant role. If you're looking to go faster on hardpack, you'll
want a tire that has shallower knobs. The Specialized Renegade Control 2Bliss
Ready T5 29" Tire is perfect for fast accelerations, climbing in hardpack
terrain, and podium finishes. It features an elevated shoulder height to
confidently carry speed through turns. The Block-in-Block design uses a taller
adapter inner block to pierce the ground and claw for traction. The tire is
2Bliss Ready for a smoother ride, better traction, and fewer flats.

### Features

  * **Gripton T5 compound** for a longer-lasting tread
  * **Control casing** that is light and durable
  * **2Bliss Ready** for a smoother ride, better traction, and fewer flats
