## Maxxis Griffin 27.5" DH Tire

If you're seating Maxxis's Griffin DH tires you better be ready to hold on
tight, because these things are fast! As the surface conditions vary between
downhill courses, the Maxxis Griffin features a less aggressive tread design
that's designed to pick up speed on hardpack trails. The knobs are smaller and
more tightly spaced, with heavily ramped leading edges to reduce rolling
resistance on tracks with lots of pedaling. Using the same durable casing
Maxxis DH tires are celebrated for, the Griffin does not sacrifice resilience.
Downhillers residing in dry areas will quickly learn to appreciate the
Griffin!

The Super Tacky option features a special low rebound, high traction compound
that perfect for cornering at high speeds.

The 3C compound option uses a harder, longer lasting base layer and two
progressively softer top layers in order to optimize traction and stability.
