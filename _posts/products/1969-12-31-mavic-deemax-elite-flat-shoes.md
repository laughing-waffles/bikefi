## Mavic Deemax Elite Flat Shoes

When you’re tackling aggressive trails, a good pedal connection can be the
difference between nailing that aggressive line you've been thinking about for
weeks or bailing out early. The Deemax Elite Flat is built with a Spider sole
design that gives you a stable connection so you can stay confident and keep
your flow going strong. They’re constructed with Contragrip sole material that
produces powerful traction, even on the most challenging mountain terrain. For
comfort, they have an Ortholite insole to offer superior cushioning on and off
the bike.

### FEATURES

  * **Spider sole design** allows you to easily move your foot on the pedal while riding and keep close control of your bike.
  * **Engineered lug pattern** is specifically designed to integrate with pedal pins.
  * **Dual-density midsole** adapts to the pedal, protects the foot, and gives you superb pedal control.
  * **Sneaker-like comfort** for on and off the bike activities.
  * **Wide front and back flex grooves** offer maximum control.
  * **Roomier fit** for some wiggle room
  * **OrthoLite insoles** offer superior cushioning for both riding and walking.
  * **Additional toe and heel protection** against rocks, roots and other trail debris.
  * **Easy to clean** synthetic material.
