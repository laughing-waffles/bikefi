## CAMELBAK SOLSTICE LR 10, 100 OZ

### SHIFTING YOUR LOAD

Water is incredibly important when you're riding. You won't get too far if
you're dehydrated. The Camelbak Solstice LR 10 shifts your load down towards
your waist to lower the center of gravity and grant a wider range of motion,
making it easier to maneuver while riding downhill. The Solstice has a 3-liter
Crux LR reservoir with a Quick Link. It has a women's specific design that is
engineered to better and more comfortably fit a women's frame, an ergonomic
S-shaped harness that better fits the contours of a women's frame, and a
women's specific ventilated hip belt with cargo pockets. The ventilated back
panel provides better ventilation, the removable bike tool organizer roll lets
you stash your CO2 cartridges, patch kits and more, and the stretch overflow
pocket lets you quickly stash or shed a layer or rain shell.

### Features

  * **Women's specific design** is engineered to better and more comfortably fit a women's frame
  * **Women's specific ventilated hip belt** with cargo pockets so you can store essentials
  * **Magnetic tube trap** keeps your tube secure and accessible
  * **Removable bike tool organizer roll** so you can stash your CO2 cartridges, patch kits, and more
