## VITTORIA CORSA CONTROL G2.0 TIRE

### CONTROLLING THE COURSE

When you're in a race, sometimes the course is well groomed and won't have any
debris, and sometimes the course isn't so nice. The Vittoria Corsa Control
G2.0 Tire is the tire choice of pro riders for races on cobbles and rougher
roads. It features a thicker tread for the best puncture protection in colder
conditions. It is built with Graphene 2.0 compound reduces the rolling
resistance and the 4C compound in the tread increases the wear life and
increases the grip.

### Features

  * **Thicker tread** provides excellent puncture protection
  * **Graphene 2.0 compound** reduces the rolling resistance
  * **4C compound** increases wear life and grip
