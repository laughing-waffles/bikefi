## SRAM Force 1 Type 3.0 Rear Derailleur

Make your front derailleur a thing of the past. Put all the gears you need at
one fingertip with a spooky-silent drivetrain and fast, quiet shifting. It
will change where you ride and the way you ride. It will open new roads.

  * With their new 1x Road lineup, SRAM took what they've learned from their 1x mountain lineup and translated that to Road and CX. Chain tension is carefully managed with the X-Horizon technology which keeps the chain movement horizontal and thus eliminating ghost shifting and reducing shifting force. Wheel changes are a snap with Cage Lock. Simply push the derailleur forward to create slack in the chain and then lock it into place. The Force 1 Derailleur is a thing of beauty. 

### Features

    * A dedicated 1x rear derailleur
    * Uses improved Type 3.0 roller clutch design
    * EXACT ACTUATION™ for fast and accurate shifts using SRAM’s 1:1 actuation ratio (shifter cable travel: derailleur movement).
    * 10- and 11-speed compatible
    * X-SYNC™ pulley features a 12-tooth design that helps control the chain’s lateral movement
    * X-HORIZON™ “straight parallelogram” design limits all movement to the horizontal axis, which makes ghost shifting impossible while also reducing shift force
    * ROLLER BEARING CLUTCH™’s one-way roller clutch controls chain tension for consistent shifting
    * Cage Lock™ technology makes for fast wheel changes or chain installation
    * Available in Short: 11-26 through 11-28 / Medium: 11-26 through 11-36 / Long 11-32 through 10-42 cage lengths
    * Weight: 261g
