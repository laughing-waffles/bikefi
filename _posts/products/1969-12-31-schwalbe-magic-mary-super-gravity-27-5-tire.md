## Schwalbe Magic Mary Super Gravity 27.5”Tire

### Mary and her Magic

The Schwalbe Magic Mary Super Gravity 27.5” Tire is an enduro riders dream
tire. Featuring an open-tread design to clear mud, large block center tread
for maximum traction in various terrains and large shoulder lugs for excellent
cornering ability. Schwalbe’s Super Gravity casing features the best balance
of protection and low rolling resistance due to combining attributes from the
Super Trail and Super Downhill casings. A four-ply casing offers extra
stiffness and Apex protection provides enhanced sidewall protection and
lateral stability, making for one tough tire. SnakeSkin protection adds a
layer of bead-to-bead puncture protection for maximum coverage on rough
trails. Pick between the Addix Ultra Soft compound for maximum grip or the
Addix Soft compound for great grip and speed. With Schwalbe’s TL Easy
technology, you can leave the tubes behind and run your Magic Mary tubeless
for less weight and maximum traction.
