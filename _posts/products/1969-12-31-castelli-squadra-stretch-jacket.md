## Castelli Squadra Stretch Jacket

### Packable, high-performance wind protection

The Castelli Squadra Stretch Jacket is the next evolutionary step for what a
packable wind layer can be. Windproof ripstop nylon panels on the front, back
and sleeves take the bite out of those chilly windy days. To achieve a more
comfortable fit, Castelli engineered tightly knit high-stretch side panels,
providing a slimmer fit without restricting movement. This not only provides
better aerodynamics (no more baggy layers!) it also improves insulation when
compared to a baggier shell. The jacket is compact and packable when not
needed—perfect to fit in a jersey pocket—and even has reflective details for
low-light conditions. The Squadra Stretch is bound to be your go-to jacket,
keeping you riding when the weather is questionable.
