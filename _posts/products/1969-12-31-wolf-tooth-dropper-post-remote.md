## Wolf Tooth Remote

Our good friends over at Wolf Tooth Components have listened to customer
complaints and suggestions in regards to the current state of dropper seat
post remotes. The Wolf Tooth ReMote is an upgrade for cable actuated dropper
out there in the market today. From its hassle-free installation to smooth
ball bearing action to engineered failure point, the lightweight ReMote makes
getting low easier.

### Features

  * Lever pivots on a 21mm ball bearing for smooth operation
  * Cable Kind Clamp does not damage secured cables and features captive hardware 
  * Includes barrel adjuster for on the fly changes
  * Engineered break-away pivot that allows the lever to break away from the pivot in the event of a crash 
  * Integrates with Shimano I-Spec II equipped brake levers for better ergonomics
  * Please note, only the remote is included. No cable or housing is included.

### Mounting Types

  * ReMote IS-AB for Shimano I-Spec A or B - Includes IS-AB Hardware
  * ReMote IS-II for Shimano I-Spec II - Includes IS-II Hardware 
  * ReMote MM SRAM/Avid MatchMaker X - Does NOT inlcude the MatchMaker hardware. We sell the MatchMaker kit separately, as most brakes will have come with them. If you need the matchmaker bracket be sure to add it to your order. 
  * SRAM Level and Level T brakes are not compatible, so use the ReMote 22
  * ReMote 22 - includes hinged handlebar clamp for 22.2mm handlebars
