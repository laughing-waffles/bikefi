## CRANKBROTHERS HIGHLINE 3 DROPPER POST

### WITH INFINITE ADJUSTMENT

Dropper posts have revolutionized the way mountain bikers ride their bikes. A
dropper post lets riders quickly lift and lower their saddles so they can
efficiently climb with a full leg extension and safely descend with a lower
center of gravity. The Crankbrothers Highline 3 Dropper Post delivers infinite
adjustment, a smooth feel, and easy installation for any bike. It features a
shorter insertion length to fit more bikes, premium Trelleborg sealing,
exclusive Igus LL-glide bearings and keys and a Jagwire cable and housing. The
self-contained hydraulic cartridge is high quality and reliable and the quick
connect mechanism makes cable installation is a breeze. The Highline 3 is
available in multiple travel lengths and diameters making this perfect for
trail, all-mountain, enduro, and DH.
