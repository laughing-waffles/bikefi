## Fox Enduro D3O Knee Guards

### Allowing you to shred with confidence

With each passing season, mountain biking technology progresses further by
making bikes lighter and faster and our equipment more capable, in return,
allowing us to ride faster and go bigger than ever before. However, this also
means accidents and crashes will be more prevalent, resulting in injuries. To
combat this, Fox partnered with D3O® to design safety equipment specifically
tailored to riders who love to shred the trails. Introducing the Fox Enduro
D3O® Knee Guards, a shredtastic combination of impact absorbing technology and
value focused design. Featuring D3O® inserts, the Enduro Knee Guard stays
flexible for ease of movement and comfort, but upon impact, instantly hardens
to dissipate the force of the crash. The reinforced skid plate reduces
friction with the ground in a sliding fall and Cordura® fabric offers higher
abrasion resistance in key impact areas.

### Features

  * **D3O® inserts** For unbeatable protection.
  * **Safety** EN1621-1 Level 1 CE certification.
  * **Extra protection** Reinforced skid plate reduces friction with the ground in a sliding fall.
