## KENDA ALLUVIUM PRO GRAVEL TIRE

### BUILT FOR GRAVEL AND ADVENTURE

If you’re a rider who craves adventure during every ride, then you’ll want to
get some tires to support your riding. The Kenda Alluvium Pro Gravel Tire is
capable on both the pavement and on single track trails. The tread design of
the Alluvium Pro is optimized for speed and has low profile knobs to aid in
reducing rolling resistance. It also has a new single tread rubber compound
that offers speed and grip. The GCT casing wraps the tire from bead to bead
with a secondary casing layer acting as a shield against punctures and
sidewall slashes. With this GCT casing, setting up this tire tubeless will be
a breeze.

### Features

  * **Tubeless ready** so you can drop the tire pressure for a smoother ride and better traction
  * **GCT casing** provides puncture resistance and sidewall protection
  * **Reflective Hot Patch** increases visibility in low-light conditions
