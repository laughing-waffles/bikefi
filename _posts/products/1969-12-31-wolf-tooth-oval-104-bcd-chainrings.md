## wolf tooth powertrac chainring 104 BCD

The Wolf Tooth Powertrac Chainring works with your biomechanics to achieve
optimal efficiency and power with every pedal stroke. Not only will you gain
more power, but you will also benefit from greater traction, and less
shifting. Wolf Tooth's proprietary design is less ovalized than its
competitors, eliminating the funky, uneven pedaling sensation while delivering
the optimum pedal stroke. Just like Wolf Tooth's other single speed
chainrings, the Powertrac features Drop-Stop tooth profile that holds chain
snugly to the chainring. Wolf Tooth offers PowerTrac Elliptical rings in a
wide variety of sizes to fit all major brands' cranks. Just pick your size and
configuration, order, install, and start pedaling as normal - your new oval
rings will do the rest!

### Features

  * Compatible with 10, 11, and 12-speed chains (except Shimano 12-speed)
  * Elliptical design improves power and effeciency
  * Drop-Stop chain retention
  * Available in assorted sizes and colors

  * 104 BCD
