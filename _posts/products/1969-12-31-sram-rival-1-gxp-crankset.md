## SRAM Rival 1 GXP 50 Tooth Crankset

### 1x for the new era of road

The SRAM Rival 1 GXP Crankset is part of the Rival 1 groupset that was born
out of the SRAM 1x11 groups from their mountain bike line. These technologies
have now transferred to the road, gravel bike and cyclocross world. The forged
aluminum spider features X-SYNC technology with their tall square profile that
engages the chain earlier and help keep the chain under control.

The SRAM Rival 1 Cranks are designed to be used with a GXP bottom bracket and
features a 50T chainring. Also available separately are 38, 40, 42, 44, 46,
and 48 tooth spiders.

### Features:

  * Forged aluminum and interchangeable spider 
  * X-SYNC tall, square tooth design provides maximum chain control 
  * SRAM PC1130 chain recommended 
  * Designed for 1x drivetrains 
  * Compatible with GXP bottom brackets
