## SRAM Rival 22 Hydraulic Brake and Shifter

SRAM's Rival group might get pushed around by its lighter, more popular older
siblings from time to time, but that doesn't mean it doesn't come from the
same family. Sure, it weights a little more, but performance wise, it has
SRAM's legendary efficiency built into its DNA.

The SRAM Rival 22 Shifter is modeled after SRAM's best-in-class Red 22
shifter. Using the same ErgoFit design as the Red 22, the Rival 22 features an
ergonomically optimized design with a textured body that improve grip and
finger wrap. Reach adjustability allows the rider to fine tune the reach
position of both the brake lever and shifter individually, making ergonomic
fit a non-issue. Just like it's snobbier siblings, SRAM Rival features
DoubleTap shift technology. DoubleTap® makes changing gears easier and faster,
eliminating the cumbersome and awkward engagement associated with two-lever
systems. DoubleTap handles up and downshifts in one short, sweeping motion,
with minimal effort and maximum comfort no matter where you are on the bars.

Now available with SRAM hydraulic rim and disc brakes, Rival 22 is better than
ever. The Rival 22 Hydraulic Rim Brake is made from forged aluminum and
features tool-free contact point adjust, SwissStop pads, and a tire clearance
of up to 28mm. The Rival 22 Hydraulic Disc Brake is a fully-sealed disc brake
system with optimized power and modulation for road or cyclocross performance.
The forged aluminum disc caliper with stainless steel backed pads and titanium
hardware stands up to all manner of cyclocross abuse and features a road-
specific piston ratio that ensures that your stopping power is just right.

Rival has fought its way through all kinds of friendly hazing. Noogies, atomic
wedgies, keep away, you name it. A true workhorse, Rival is ready to play with
the big boys.
