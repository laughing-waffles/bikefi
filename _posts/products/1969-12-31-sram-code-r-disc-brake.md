## SRAM Code R Brakes

Using SRAM's latest braking technology, the CODE R just got a facelift. With
an all new, forged dual-diameter, four-piston caliper, CODE R comes through
with increased power, and without compromising control or feel. With a
simplified design that doesn't break the bank, CODE R maintains the CODE
family values of reliability, strength, and exceedingly convenient
serviceability. Now featuring the fade-free braking of TaperBore Technology
and the sleek and powerful integrated reservoir on top of Avid's proven Power
Reserve Geometry, the CODE R will make you think before you label it a second-
rate brake.
