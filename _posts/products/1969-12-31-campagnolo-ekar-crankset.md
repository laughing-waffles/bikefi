## Campagnolo EKAR Crankset - Carbon

### Heart of the Ekar Groupset

Campagnolo’s latest and greatest groupset, Ekar, is their first foray into
gravel specific drivetrains. Its 1x13-speed configuration offers an incredible
range of gears that rivals traditional 2x11-speed setups without the weight
penalty or added complexity. A quality crankset is needed to power this
industry leading drivetrain. Fortunately, Campagnolo have taken their
expertise and created a top of the line crankset that’s worthy of the name
“Ekar”. The Ekar crankset features a durable, extremely stiff, and lightweight
carbon crank arm. The unidirectional carbon crank arm offers maximum power
transfer and minimal rotational weight in order to provide maximum efficiency.
A 630-grade steel alloy crank axle is robust and stiff for long lasting
performance. New ProTech technology features buttery smooth oversized
stainless steel bearings that sit against the crank and are easily accessible
for maintenance.

For chainring options the Ekar crankset has four choices, a 38T, 40T, 42T, or
a 44T. Each has their own purpose and when paired with the 9T or 10T cog on
the Ekar cassette offer an incredible high gear without losing any low gear.
The 38T is optimized for steep climbs and adventure riding where you’re not
entirely sure what you may run into. The 40T is perfect for all around gravel
scenarios and is the true jack of all trades option. The 42T is ideal for fast
gravel scenarios but can handle some climbing situations as well. The 44T is
designed for e-bike use and gravel scenarios that see less elevation or for
bikes that may do double duty as a road bike. All chainrings are engineered
with Campagnolo’s Micro Precision Shifting System (M.P.S.) which helps keep
shifting crisp and chain retention at a max. Campagnolo uses a four arm 123bcd
chainring setup which makes swapping chainrings and altering your setup a
breeze without the need for dissembling your cranks. Standard crank arm
lengths give you plenty of options to meet every rider's criteria or
preference.
