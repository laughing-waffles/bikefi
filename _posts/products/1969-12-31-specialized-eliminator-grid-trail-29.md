## SPECIALIZED ELIMINATOR GRID TRAIL 29" TIRE

### ELIMINATING THE TRAILS

When it comes to riding in the dirt, the tires you use have a significant
impact on your riding performance. Tires designed for hardpack dirt might not
perform well in loose or sandy conditions. The Specialized Eliminator Grid
Trail 29" Tire combines an aggressive block design with a well-balanced tread
pattern. It has transition knobs that bridge the traditional channel between
the center and shoulder knobs. This makes it perfect for Enduro riding and
riding in rougher conditions. The GRID TRAIL casing is stiffer while delivers
better handling at lower pressures and provides 15% better pinch flat
protection and 30% better puncture protection.

### Features

  * **2Bliss ready** for a smoother ride, better traction, and fewer flats
  * **GRID TRAIL casing** additional bead to bead protection for exceptional puncture resistance, sidewall stiffness and stability.
  * **Flat protection** with 15% better pinch flat protection and 30% better puncture protection
