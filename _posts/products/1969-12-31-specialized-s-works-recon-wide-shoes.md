## SPECIALIZED S-WORKS RECON WIDE SHOES

### Style meets Performance

When it comes to gravel, cyclocross, and cross country racing, you want to
make sure you have excellent cycling shoes on. The Specialized S-Works Recon
Shoes check all the boxes when it comes to being lightweight, having
exceptional power transfer, and having excellent style. The S-Works Recon
Shoes feature Body Geometry sole and footbeds that boost power, increase
efficiency, and reduces the chance of injury. The FACT carbon plate in the
shoes is the stiffest and lightest mixed-terrain plate. The upper has Dyneema
Mesh that is trapped between layers of four-way stretch mesh and TPU to create
no-stretch zones for the best connection and comfort. The upper also features
independent alloy BOA S3-Snap dials that provide a quick and easy way to dial
in the perfect fit.

The Padlock heel construction cradles the heel and improves acceleration. The
outsole has SlipNot rubber heel and toe tread offers the shoe exceptional
traction when you're on or off the bike and also features removable toe studs.
These shoes have a form fit last and have a roomy toe box for more comfort.
With a two-bolt cleat pattern fits all major mountain bike pedals.
