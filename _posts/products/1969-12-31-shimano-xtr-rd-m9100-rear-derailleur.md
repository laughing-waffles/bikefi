## SHIMANO XTR RD-M9100 REAR DERAILLEUR

### WE XT"R" SO EXCITED

Shimano has been making some of the best bicycle components since the 1970's
and they continue to produce some of the most sought-after components in the
industry. XTR is Shimano's top-of-the-line mountain bike group and features
some of the finest technology and produces an incredibly clean and reliable
shift. The newest generation of XTR is not only new and shiny, it comes with
all-new technology. The Shimano XTR RD-M9100 Rear Derailleur has been upgraded
from 11-speed to 12-speed and has the capacity to go up to a 51 tooth cog on
the rear. The RD-M9100 is designed for 1x12 drivetrains and comes in GS (short
cage) and SGS (long cage). The GS will go up to a 45 tooth cog on the rear and
the SGS will go up to a 51 tooth.

### Features

  * **Designed to work with 1x12 drivetrains**
  * **GS cage goes up to a 45 tooth cog** and the SGS goes up to a 51 tooth cog
  * **13 tooth pulleys** instead of 11 tooth pulleys
  * **Decreased rear derailleur tension** at low gear position, to prevent high chain tension at low gear
  * **Added bumper at rear derailleur pulley cage** for silent operation
