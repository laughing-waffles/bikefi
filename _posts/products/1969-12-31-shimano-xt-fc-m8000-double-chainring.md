## Shimano XT FC-M8000 Double Chainring

For optimal performance from your M8000 crankset, use only authentic Shimano
chainrings. Shimano's new M8000 3D composite chainrings are precisely
engineered for specific 2x11 chainwheel load, improving chain retention,
shifting and prolonging the life of the chainring making Shimano chainrings
the superior choice for all conditions.

Choose the correct chainrings for your application. Shimano chainrings are
engineered to work as a pair in a specific gear combination, as noted on the
list of sizes we have available. If you are replacing an inner ring, be sure
to use the same size to ensure proper shifting.

### Features

  * Enhanced Chain Retention
  * Rhythm Step Gear Ratios are carefully designed for optimal power and efficiency
  * Improved Shifting
  * Longer Lasting
  * Compatible with XT M8000 Crankset (if you are converting from a single ring to double rings, new, shorter chainring bolts are required.)
  * B.C.D. 96/64mm
  * Chainring Sizes: 38-28T, 36-26T, 34-24T
