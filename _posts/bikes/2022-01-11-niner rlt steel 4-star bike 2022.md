<p>Road bikes are only great for the pavement, but if you want to go beyond that, you'll want a gravel bike. Gravel bikes bridge the gap so you can ride on pavement and continue going when the dirt begins. The Niner RLT 9 Steel 4-Star Bike is designed for adventure and versatility. It has a Reynolds 853 Steel frame and an RDO carbon fork. The frame is compatible with both 700 x 50c tires and 650b x 2.0" tires. The frame also features integrated frame mounts, external cable routing, and rack and fender mounts so you can easily transform this bike into a daily commuter or touring bike.</p>
