Looking for a heavy duty wheel that’s made for speed? The BBR Tuning 26 Inch Heavy Duty 10 Spoke STAR Motorized Bike Mag Wheel Set is exactly what you’ve been looking for. Disc-brake ready and pre-installed with a motorized bike sprocket, these wheels will hold up better than any set of wheels you’ve ever used on your bike. Unlike your run-of-the-mill bike wheels, these mag wheels are made for motorized bike riding. These heavy metal wheels have no spokes, which means you’re never truing your wheels to keep them straight- they’re permanently straight! Their upgraded bearings hold up much longer than bike bearings and are made to take high speeds, whereas most bike wheels are only meant to take speeds of up to 10 MPH (and we all know motorized bikes go faster than that).
Each set of STAR mag wheels are disc break-ready. Both the front and rear wheels have 6x stud ports you can install nearly any disc brake rotor to, which means you don’t have to use any more messy adapters to get a disc brake on there. Each rear wheel comes with its own 36 tooth motorized bike sprocket, which means you’ll get lots of top end speed without the hassle of installing one of those ugly, rubber rag joints or expensive adapters to your bike. Graphics on wheel are stickers and are easily removable as desired.
These wheels are also single-walled with tire lips big enough to fit fat, knobby 26” tires with lots of grip and tubes that hold tons of air. As far as installation, it couldn’t be any easier: 
• Install the disc of your disc brake assembly on to the studs of the wheel and fasten them
• Install a single-speed freewheel or 3-7 speed cassette on to the rear wheel and lock it in place 
• Line each wheel with tire liner, then install your inner tubes and tires
• Install the wheels on to your bike, fasten down the remaining nuts on their axles, and align your chain  Whether you’re riding on the streets, on the trail, or on the track, riding with the BBR Tuning 26 Inch Heavy Duty 10 Spoke STAR Motorized Bike Mag Wheel Set will have you riding in style and security.
