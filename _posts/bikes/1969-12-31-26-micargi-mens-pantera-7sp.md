Create a style statement and get ahead of others with the Micargi men’s pantera 7SP. The bike’s wide moon bars, comfy cruiser saddle and white wall tires make it class apart from the other competitive bikes available in the market. The v-brakes are easy to maintain, replace and do not strain the spokes promising a long life.



Colored Chain Guard: The enclosed chain saves the cyclist’s clothes from getting trapped in the chain guard.


Alloy V-Brakes: Plenty of power and your safety is the assurance of v-brakes.


Full Fenders: Mud, water and dirt cannot get to you with the full fenders which provide you with partial protection from everything lying on the road.


Steel Chrome Frame: The frame is strong and high-end road material capable of withstanding whatever there is on the road.



The bike has been composed of hi-ten steel frame and has been equipped with latest components which makes it one of the best available in the industry. The bike uses alloy v-brakes, white walled tires, steel chrome handlebar, full fenders, chain guard, rear reflector and comfy saddle with springers.

With the high-stopping power of the v-brakes, your safety is ensured on all the challenging roads. V-brakes allow easy maintenance and replacement, so you do not have to worry about the spending massively on the v-brakes.

Chain guard does not let any outside component interrupt the functioning of the bike. With partial protection the chain guard gives to the chain a long life. The comfortable padded bike seat comes with springers which absorbs and dissipates the shocks throughout the seat, so your back does not hurt.

With the Pantera beach cruiser, you get multiple 7- speed options to ride while facing varied challenges on the road. The 26"X2.125" black/white wall tires not only enhance the look of the bike but give added strength to tires to withstand pressure and perform efficiently.
