<h2 class="from-description-field">Octane One Prone 29” Frame</h2>
<p>The Prone 29" Frame from Octane One is a tough, stylish and lightweight hardtail that's ideal for riding your favourite singletrack and bike park trails. This frame is durable and agile and is compatible with up to 130mm-travel suspension forks, 2.3" wide tyres and is designed for use with a 1x drivetrain only.</p>
<h3>Durable, Agile and Stylish 29"-Wheel Hardtail Frame</h3>
<p>Tough hardtail, for your favourite trail shredding. Two models for slightly different applications. The 27.5” version is slacker, more aggressive and designed for forks with longer travel. The big wheel (29”) version with a bit steeper and "pedal friendly" angles and bigger frame sizing is a great choice for long, epic rides. Both frames have been built in line with our dirt jumping heritage – we used beefy AL6061 tubes with custom butting. The Prone frame is as tough as nails and will survive a lot of abuse.</p>
