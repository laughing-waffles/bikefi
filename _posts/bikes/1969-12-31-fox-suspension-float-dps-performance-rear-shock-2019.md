<h2 class="from-description-field">Fox Suspension Float Performance Rear Shock</h2>
<p>Prepared for long days on your favourite trails with your riding buddies as well as solo adventures exploring new routes across the mountain, this versatile rear shock is developed for smooth and dependable rear end suspension performance. Part of Fox Suspension's Performance Series, it comes equipped with a high-quality anodised finish that ensures extra durability and protection against corrosion, making it perfect for all-weather and terrain conditions. Another highlight is this model's lightweight Float EVOL air spring, which uses its one-piece air sleeve to deliver improved responsiveness and sensitivity as you charge across demanding trail conditions. Coming complete with a DPS damper that uses a three-position adjustment lever, you'll enjoy its ease of use when dialling in your settings.</p>

<h3>Exceptional Bump Compliance Meets Exceptional Efficiency</h3>

<p>A lightweight chassis, EVOL air spring, and dual piston damper with 3-position switch create a pedal-friendly shock that soaks up the bumps and delivers pedal power to the ground with utmost efficiency.</p>
