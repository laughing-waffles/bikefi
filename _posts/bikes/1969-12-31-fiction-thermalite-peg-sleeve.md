<h2 class="from-description-field">Fiction Thermalite Peg Sleeve</h2>
<p>The Fiction Thermalite Peg Sleeve is the same sleeve found on the Stolen Silencer, Stolen Night Stalker and Fiction Troop pegs. Featuring a lightweight, durable construction made from Stolen's special Thermalite material. This outer sleeve is designed to resist cracking and deforming and has an extremely smooth finish. This sleeve design is known to slide much better on most surfaces than a CrMo peg. If you love grinding with the compatible pegs, this will be a great replacement when the time comes to give your bike a facelift.</p>
<h3>Features:</h3>

<li><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 112mm x 40mm</li>
