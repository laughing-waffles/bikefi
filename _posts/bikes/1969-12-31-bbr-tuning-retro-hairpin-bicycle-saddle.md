Tired of that old, torn foam seat giving your bike a bad look? The BBR Tuning Retro Hairpin Saddle will give your cruiser, mountain bike, or road bike a vintage look with comfort included. Made with tanned leather and durable metal springs, you’ll be riding in style with this seat on your bike.
Metal rivets hold the durable leather to the frame. Unlike other hairpin saddles out there, the BBR Tuning hairpin saddle is made with real leather, not plastic. That means despite its hard surface, when sit down on this saddle you won’t feel like you’re sitting on an old school, plastic BMX saddle.
Its large springs ensure that whether you’re riding on pavement or on rocky terrain, you don’t feel too much of the rumble of the road. And its adjustable seat post clamp allows for mounting on a wide range of seat posts of different sizes.
Installing this saddle couldn’t be easier:

Loosen the seat clamp on your existing seat and remove it from your seat tube
Loosen the seat clamp of the BBR Tuning Retro Hairpin saddle
Fit the new saddle over your seat tube and adjust the direction of your seat to comfort
Tighten the seat clamp, and you’re ready to ride!

So whether it’s more comfort, more reliability, or a new look out of your bicycle’s seat, the BBR Tuning Retro Hairpin Saddle will give you all three!
