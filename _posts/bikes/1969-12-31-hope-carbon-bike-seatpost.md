<h2 class="from-description-field">Hope Carbon Bike Seatpost</h2>
<p>Designed, constructed and extensively tested in the United Kingdom (UK), Hope has packed its very best construction techniques into its Carbon Bike Seatpost. It brings you the strength and performance needed to ride your bike at its limit. Lightweight and stiff enough for cross country (XC) racing and tough enough for riding aggressive downhill (DH) trails, it also has super-fine angle adjustment for obtaining the perfect saddle position.</p>
<p>Each seat-post employs 24 individual &quot;plies&quot; of carbon, pre-impregnated with a highly toughened epoxy resin system, designed to ensure a safe and rugged unit.<strong> </strong>The bulk of the laminate comprises Unidirectional T700 fibre – the highest strength Standard Modulus fibre available. (Unidirectional fibres provide the maximum tensile strength and stiffness with minimum weight.) </p>
<p>The strategically positioned plies of 3K twill woven fabric, add hoop strength to resist clamping forces and mitigating failure mode in the event of serious crash damage. The 1K 2x2 twill weave fabric outer ply also contributes in this respect, together with a super smooth finish and striking visual aesthetic.</p><h3>Features:</h3><ul>
