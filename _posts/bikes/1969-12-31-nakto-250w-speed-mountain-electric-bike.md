Manufactured by Nakto, a company based in Chino, California, the Nakto 250W Speed Mountain Electric Bike is an environmentally friendly e-bike that has been specifically designed for use as a mountain bike. Coming complete with motor, battery and charger all included, the Nakto 250W Speed mountain bike also includes a complimentary toolkit and a comprehensive user manual.
Despite the sleek good looks of the Nakto Speed mountain bike, this e-bike is much more than just a pretty face. Built to stand up to the rigors of riding over rough trails, the Nakto Speed electric mountain bike has a high quality steel frame and flat handlebars that allow riders to lean forwards over them. To ensure the Nakto Speed mountain e-bike will stop when you need it to, the bike has been fitted with both front and rear disc brakes. This combination of mechanical disc brakes means the Speed mountain e-bike will be better able to cope with braking in wet weather conditions. For improved visibility in low light, the Nakto Speed mountain bike comes standard with a 360 degree lighting system that runs off the power of the 36 volt lithium battery.
To make sure you’re getting the most out of your trail riding, the Nakto 250W Speed e-bike has been fitted with a 6 speed derailleur system manufactured by Shimano (a brand name synonymous with quality bicycle parts). This derailleur system means that the chain of the Speed mountain e-bike can be moved between different sized sprockets, allowing for improved performance when traveling up or down steep inclines.
Electric mountain bikes are an ideal choice for riders seeking a compromise between a regular pushbike and a more powerful motorcycle. The 250 watt brushless electric motor gives superior speed when compared with just pedal power, as well as making it possible for riders to travel further. But, the electric mountain bike is still an excellent means of exercise, since the motor is programmed with 3 different power settings and 6 separate speeds. This allows riders to program in what kind of assistance they want the electric motor to give them, using the simple LCD display function.
