&#35;&#35;&#35; An urban cyclist's dream

The Muirwoods RC is king of the concrete jungle. It's a steel mountain bike
with slick tires. If you like sprinting through town and jumping every curb
you come upon, the Muirwoods is your next favorite bike. The bike's fast,
responsive, and durable manner is ready for anything. The powerful hydraulic
disc brakes give you ultimate control and the steel construction of the frame
and fork provide an excellent ride quality. In the age of carbon fiber and
aluminum frames dominating the bike market, CrMo steel remains a favorite
amongst many for its strength and lively ride quality.

&#35;&#35;&#35; Features

  * **Chromoly frame and fork** provide an excellent ride quality
  * **Hydraulic disc brakes** front and back provide powerful and consistent stopping power
  * **Internal hub drivetrain** is simple and gives you a wide gear range for all the hills
  * **Front and rear fenders** keep the rain and dust down on the ground
  * **Reflective Graphics** help you be seen while sprinting around at night
  * **47c wide tires** make easy work off any curbs or rough matches that pop up in your way
