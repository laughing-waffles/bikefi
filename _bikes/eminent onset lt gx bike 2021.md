&#35;&#35;&#35; The Swiss Army Knife

Mountain biking is all about having fun while you're out on the trail. With an
all-mountain bike, you'll be able to conquer the descents and climb with ease.
The Eminent Onset LT GX Bike is designed to be predictable in all the right
ways so you can confidently ride the trails. It has a lightweight and highly
durable carbon fiber frame that utilizes 150mm of travel on the front and
140mm of travel on the rear. The rear suspension uses AFS for unmatched
climbing efficiency and quick responsiveness. The frame also features a carbon
downtube protector, an integrated seat clamp, and internal carbon tubes for
cable routing.

The GX version of the Eminent Onset LT comes with a SRAM GX Eagle 12-speed
drivetrain. The cassette comes with a hill-crushing 10-51T gear range that
makes climbing and pedaling through rough terrain. TRP Slate 4-piston
hydraulic disc brakes provide exceptional stopping power so you can descend
with confidence. Crankbrothers Synthesis Enduro Alloy wheels are paired with
Vittoria Mazza and Martello tires that can be set up tubeless for a smoother
ride, better traction, and fewer flats. With the KS Rage dropper post, you'll
be able to quickly lift and lower your saddle with the press of a lever.
