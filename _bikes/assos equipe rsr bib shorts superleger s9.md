&#35;&#35;&#35; Max airflow for max efforts

On the hottest days, airflow is critical. Part of the the hot weather
Superleger series, the Equipe RS Superleger S9 bibs are the most breathable
shorts Assos has ever designed, and are intended for the hottest days and
hardest efforts. The Superleger bibs use hyper-light fabric and specifically-
located compressive Breezer Tex mesh panels to increase airflow and moisture
dissipation—even the bib straps have been designed to absorb less sweat. The
S9 race platform design creates a stable structure to the bib short design,
providing support when your weight transfers in the saddle, while A-Lock
engineering secures the chamois in place to ensure optimal comfort during hard
efforts. These bibs are designed from top-to-bottom to be some of the most
breathable, comfortable bibs available—whether you’re racing up Alpe D'huez,
or tackling an epic indoor training session.
