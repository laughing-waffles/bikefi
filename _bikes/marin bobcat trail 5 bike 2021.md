description: "&#35;&#35; MARIN BOBCAT TRAIL 5 BIKE 2021

&#35;&#35;&#35; A HIGHLY CAPABLE MOUNTAIN BIKE

Hardtail mountain bikes are perfect for singletrack and fire road riding.
Hardtails are efficient at climbing and accelerate quickly on the flats. The
Marin Bobcat Trail 5 Bike is a capable mountain bike with modern trail
geometry. It is built for exploring the trails and has a lightweight Series 2
6061 aluminum frame. The frame features internal cable routing and uses 120mm
of travel on the front. The Bobcat Trail uses 27.5" wheels on S, and M frame
sizes and 29" wheels on M, L, and XL frame sizes.

The 5 version of the Marin Bobcat Trail comes with a Shimano Deore 11-speed
drivetrain. This includes a cassette that has an ultra-wide-range 11-46T gear
range that makes climbing and riding in rough terrain a breeze. Shimano
BR-M201 hydraulic disc brakes provide excellent stopping power so you can
descend with confidence. Marin aluminum double-wall rims are paired with WTB
Trailboss Comp tires. The rims are tubeless-ready and when paired with
tubeless tires, you can ditch the tubes and drop the tire pressure for a
smoother ride, better traction, and fewer flats. While the Bobcat Trail does
come with a rigid seatpost, it is compatible with dropper posts.
