&#35;&#35;&#35; Upping The Ante

Trail bikes are designed to conquer difficult descents and climb efficiently.
They have longer travel than a cross-country bike and feature a more
aggressive geometry. The Diamondback Atroz 2 Bike took the proven and refined
single-pivot full-suspension design and upped the ante. It has a 6061 aluminum
frame that uses 120mm of travel on the front and 100mm of travel on the rear.
The frame features an internal dropper post routing.

The Atroz 2 comes with a Shimano Acera M3000 9-speed drivetrain. This includes
a cassette that has a wide-range 11-36T gear range that makes climbing and
pedaling through rough terrain easier. Shimano MT200 hydraulic disc brakes
provide reliable stopping power so you can descend under control. With double-
wall aluminum wheels and Vee Rubber Flow Snap tires, you'll have excellent
traction in a wide variety of conditions.
