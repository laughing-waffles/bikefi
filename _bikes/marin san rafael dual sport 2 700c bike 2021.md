&#35;&#35;&#35; FOR MIXED SURFACES AND TERRAIN

Maybe you want to ride the pavement one day and maybe you want to ride the
trails tomorrow. If you can't decide where you want to ride, you should look
at getting a dual sportbike. The Marin San Rafael Dual Sport 2 700c Bike is
for riders looking to explore mixed surfaces and terrain and ride in new
locations. The San Rafael features a 6061 aluminum frame that has a rear rack
and fender mounts so you can easily carry your gear and essentials with you.
The frame uses 63mm of travel on the front and has wide tire clearance.

This version of the Marin San Rafael comes with a Shimano Acera 2x8-speed
drivetrain. The gearing is perfect for long climbs and fun days out on the
trail. Tektro M275 hydraulic disc brakes perform well in various weather
conditions so you can ride in the dirt, wet, and dry with ease. With the Marin
aluminum alloy rims and Vee Tire Rail tires, you'll have excellent traction
when riding on dirt while also being able to roll quickly on the pavement.
