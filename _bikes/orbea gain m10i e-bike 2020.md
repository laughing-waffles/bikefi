&#35;&#35;&#35; ALL GAIN, NO PAIN

E-Bikes are growing in popularity because they help riders climb to new
heights and push the boundaries of what they are capable of. Pedal-assist
bikes can easily be turned off for those times when you don't need it and
turned back on for those tougher climbs or rougher rides. The Orbea Gain M10i
E-Bike was designed to enhance your ride, not dominate it. The Gain has a
carbon fiber frame with flat-mount disc brakes. The Ebikemotion X35 motor and
the integrated battery are hidden away inside the frame. The frame has ample
tire clearance so you can run up to 700x40c tires for ultimate comfort on
rough pavement.

The M10i version of the Orbea Gain E-Bike comes with a Shimano Dura-Ace Di2
R9150 2x11-speed drivetrain. The gearing is perfect for climbing and riding
longer distances. Shimano R9170 hydraulic disc brakes provide exceptional
stopping power so you can descend with confidence. Mavic Cosmic Pro Carbon
Disc wheels are paired with Mavic Yksion Pro tires that can be set up tubeless
for a smoother ride, better traction, and fewer flats.

&#35;&#35;&#35; Features

  * **Carbon frame** that has wide tire clearance, an integrated battery, and internal cable routing
