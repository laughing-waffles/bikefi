&#35;&#35;&#35; Reliable high-performance rain protection

The Haven is POCâ€™s expertly-engineered waterproof jacket for road riders who
require high performance from their waterproof apparel. The Haven features a
triple-layered lightweight ripstop polyamide fabric which is completely
waterproof, DWR-coated and boasts fully taped seams to prevent water ingress.
The lightweight fabric also offers excellent moisture permeability to keep you
dry from the inside and out. Back and underarm ventilation keeps the air
moving during grueling climbs, while elastic wrists and waist hem keep the
jacket in place during the fastest of descents. The POC Haven jacket keeps you
dry no matter the ride, helping you push your limits in all conditions.
