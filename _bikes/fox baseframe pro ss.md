With each passing season, mountain biking technology progresses further by
making bikes lighter and faster and our equipment more capable, in return,
allowing us to ride faster and go bigger than ever before. However, this also
means accidents and crashes will be more prevalent, resulting in injuries. To
combat this, Fox partnered with D3O® to design safety equipment specifically
tailored to riders who love to shred the trails. Introducing the Fox Baseframe
Pro SS body armor, a low profile protective base layer that is designed to fit
underneath your jersey. Featuring D3O world leading impact protection
technology, the Baseframe Pro SS has a D3O inserts on the back, chest and
shoulders that exceeds EN1621-1 level 1 impact protection standards. The
entire base layer is made of moisture wicking, open stretch mesh for
breathability and comfort.
