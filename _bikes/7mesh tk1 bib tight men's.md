The 7mesh TK1 Bib Tight is a winter road riding bib tight designed for maximum
comfort in less than ideal weather. The TK1 Bib Tights feature a durable nylon
exterior with a DWR water-resistant coating and has a soft fleece interior to
keep you warm on those chilly rides. 45mm-thick elastic bib straps keep the
bib tights up a have a brushed knit bib strap junction for comfort. For
comfort, 7Mesh threw in their men’s Performance Force Chamois, which uses a
multi-directional curvature design for the most comfortable fit in the saddle.
The leg is articulated to help with the fit and the clean-cut leg hem is
trimmable by up to 2.5-inches. Finally, three rear stretch mesh pockets allow
you to take your riding essentials with you.
