&#35;&#35;&#35; The Ultimate Aggressive Steel Hardtail

Hardtails are the perfect solution for someone that wants a super fun mountain
bike that can conquer the terrain with ease. With a long-travel trail bike,
you'll be able to descend with confidence and climb with ease. The Marin El
Roy Bike is the ultimate steel hardtail that'll get you to the top, and then
really shine on the way down. It has a Series 3 double-butted and formed CrMo
frame that uses 140mm of travel on the front. The frame features a gravity-
oriented geometry, Boost hub spacing, and internal dropper post routing.

The El Roy comes with a Shimano Deore 12-speed drivetrain. This includes a
cassette that has a hill-crushing 10-51T gear range that makes climbing and
pedaling through tough terrain a breeze. Shimano BR-MT420 4-piston hydraulic
disc brakes provide exceptional stopping power so you can descend the steepest
terrain under control. Marin double-wall rims are paired with Maxxis Assegai
tires that can be set up tubeless for a smoother ride, better traction, and
fewer flats. With the X-Fusion Manic dropper post, you'll be able to quickly
lift and lower your saddle with the press of a lever.
