&#35;&#35;&#35; THE SHAPESHIFTING E-GRAVEL BIKE

E-bikes are designed to remove the barriers that keep many riders from
experiencing the joys of exploring on two wheels. They don't have a throttle
but will provide pedal assistance when you need it so you can get over any
obstacle and ride farther. The Niner RLT e9 RDO 4-Star Bike is the e-version
of the RLT gravel bike that goes far and goes fast. The Niner RDO Carbon frame
features Bosch Performance that provides up to 28 miles per hour of pedal
assistance with a 500Wh battery for longer distances. The frame is designed
for durability and versatility, and the frame features rack mounts so you can
carry your supplies with you, and has clearance for up to 50c tires.

The 4-Star version of the Niner RLT e9 RDO comes with a Shimano GRX600
11-speed drivetrain. This includes a cassette that has a wide-range 11-42T
gear range that makes climbing and pedaling through rough terrain much easier.
Shimano GRX400 hydraulic disc brakes provide confidence-inspiring stopping
power so you can descend under control. Stan's NoTubes Arch D rims are paired
with Schwalbe G-One Speed Performance tires that can be set up tubeless for a
smoother ride, better traction, and fewer flats. With the Niner Carbon
seatpost, you'll have a smoother ride over rougher roads.
