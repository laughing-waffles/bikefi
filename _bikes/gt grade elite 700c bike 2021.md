&#35;&#35;&#35; Getting Good Grades

Gravel riding has become one of the most popular genres in the bike world.
With a gravel bike, you'll be able to keep riding when the pavement ends and
the dirt trail begins. The GT Grade Elite 700c Bike is designed to take you on
all-new adventures. It has an aluminum frame and a carbon fork. The frame
features EnduRoad Triple Triangle design with floating seat stays. The frame
also has external routing, a BSA 73mm BB, and flat mount disc brakes.

The Elite version of the GT Grade comes with a Shimano Claris 2c8-speed
drivetrain. The gearing is perfect for moderate hills and all-day adventures.
Tektro mechanical disc brakes provide reliable stopping power so you can ride
in various conditions with ease. With the WTB ST i23 TCS rims, you'll be able
to set them up tubeless for a smoother ride, better traction, and fewer flats.
