The Assos Cento EVO Bib Shorts 2019 offer you pure tailored comfort made for
the long hour hauls. The Cento EVO offers a comfort fit platform, evolved with
an updated insert and refinements throughout and is constructed using Type.439
textile for the main panels for incredible comfort, along with two different
rates of four-way stretch, it also delivers a nice, compressive hold for a
smooth, supportive wrap along the thighs. It also provides exceptional
breathability, and it rapidly transfers moisture to its quick-drying outer
surface, helping you stay cool and comfortable while you’re logging in the
long miles.

&#35;&#35;&#35; FEATURES

  * **Type.439 Diadema:** A textile design created with our fabric suppliers to meet our demands of performance, comfort, and durability. Unique within the industry, the weave has two different rates of 4-way stretch, requiring great expertise to maximize the elasticity of the fabric on the cutting table.
  * **CENTO S7 EVO:** The CENTO elastic interface insert, evolved. New black colorway, and our proven 10mm of memory foam, this insert is nestled at the intersection between comfort and performance.
  * **3D waffle:** A patented, three-layer perforated foam that increases breathability and eliminates excess weight.
  * **goldenGate:** A patented technology that interrupts the stitching along both of the insert’s side panels, allowing a more three-dimensional freedom of movement in this sensitive, rotational area.
  * **kukuPenthouse:** A soft, brushed microfiber layer added to the front part of the insert that supports the male anatomy, eliminates pressure, and increases ventilation.
  * **Y7 Frame Carrier Bib Tech:** Wide, flexible bib straps converge at the upper back in a Y-shape design, resulting in a flat, stable structure that disappears between the shoulder blades.
  * **Stabilizator V3:** Dorsal stabilizer in a solid mesh with limited vertical stretch. Includes updated line graphics.
  * **Ultralight Leg Grippers:** A light silicon treatment woven into the leg bands, which reduces fabric bulk and secures the shorts in place without any excessive pressure.
  * **zeroWaist:** A raw-cut, tape-reinforced edge for the smoothest transition possible between the body and fabric panel. More comfort with less pressure.
  * **Reflective Bands:** Placed on the backs of the thighs for added visibility.
  * **regularFit:** Optimized for total comfort in the riding position, with a more relaxed cut than our second-skin racingFit.
