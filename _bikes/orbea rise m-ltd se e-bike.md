&#35;&#35;&#35; Rise Above

E-mountain bikes are designed to remove many of the barriers that keep people
from enjoying the trails. With an E-MTB, you'll be able to climb and ride
longer with ease. The Orbea Rise M-LTD SE E-Bike is a machine designed to
expand your trail and bring you closer to the moment. It has an OMR carbon
frame that uses 140mm of travel on the front and rear. The frame features
Boost spacing, internal cable routing, integrated chainstay protection, and
29" wheels. With the Shimano EP8-RS motor and Orbea RS Internal 360Wh battery,
you'll have exceptional pedal assistance to boost you to the top of the
mountain.

The M-LTD SE version of the Orbea Rise E-Bike comes with a Shimano XTR M9100
12-speed drivetrain. This includes a cassette that has a hill-crushing 10-51T
gear range that makes climbing and pedaling through rough terrain a breeze.
Shimano XTR M9100 hydraulic disc brakes provide superior stopping power so you
can descend under control. Race Face Turbine wheels are paired with Maxxis
Rekon tires that can be set up tubeless for a smoother ride, better traction,
and fewer flats. With the Fox Transfer Factory Kashima Dropper Post, you'll be
able to quickly lift and lower your saddle with the press of a lever.
