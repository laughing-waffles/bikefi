&#35;&#35;&#35; Tailored to meet the Demands of Competition

In racing, milliseconds can be the difference between winning a race or losing
a race. Not to mention the rigours and stress that bib shorts go through while
racing. Fortunately, Poc has your back with the Aero VPDS Bib Shorts. These
bib shorts are optimized to provide ultimate performance without giving up any
comfort in the process. The VPD Contour Pad provides exceptional comfort
regardless if youâ€™re racing a fast crit or going out for a long day in the
saddle. 3D molded VPDS Silicone pads inside of the chamois improve the
vibration absorption and overall comfort of the bibs. The breathable and
stretchy fabric is optimized to provide exceptional compression which in turn
improves comfort and aerodynamics. The fully flatlock seams allow for a smooth
fit against your skin. 8cm-wide leg grippers keep the bibs locked in place
even when sprinting to the finish line. Mesh fabric allows for plenty of
airflow and keeps the suspenders from becoming uncomfortable on long rides.
