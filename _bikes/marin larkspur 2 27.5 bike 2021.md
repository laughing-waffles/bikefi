&#35;&#35;&#35; The Urban Warrior

Whether you're getting a couple of miles in each day, riding to work by bike,
or you're cruising to get your morning coffee, you'll want a bike that is
relaxing to comfortable to ride on. The Marin Larkspur 2 27.5" Bike is a
functional bike that picks the best from the mountain bike world and blends it
with commuter sensibility. It starts with a Series 2 Butted Chromoly frame
that has a Chromoly steel fork on the front. The frame features a place to put
a water bottle cage as well as rack and fender mounts so you can easily
transform this into your daily commuter.

The 2 version of the Marin Larkspur comes with a Shimano Deore 11-speed
drivetrain. This includes a cassette that has a hill-crushing 11-51T gear
range that makes climbing and riding with all your gear a breeze. Shimano
Deore hydraulic disc brakes provide excellent stopping power so you can
descend under control. Marin double-wall aluminum rims are paired with Vee
Tire GPVee tires that feature enhanced puncture protection. With the TranzX
dropper post, you'll be able to quickly lift and lower your saddle with the
press of a lever.
