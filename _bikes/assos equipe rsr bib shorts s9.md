To create theit lightest, most comfortable race specific bib shorts, Assos
started from scratch and re-engineered the platform as a whole. The result is
the 160g Assos Equipe RSR Bib Shorts S9 2019. They’re the ideal bib shorts for
cornering, abrupt transitions between road surfaces, constant in-to-out-of-
saddle pedaling, and hours of body repositioning – fit for a world class
athlete. They utilize the new Type.701kompressor fabric, which a complex woven
textile that delivers on all fronts using ultrathin yarns with super-high
elasticity, yielding a near-frictionless weave that provides you with
incredible comfort and muscle support. In other words, Type.701 becomes your
second skin, delivering phenomenal structural hold, breathability, and a silky
smooth, uninterrupted wrap along the low back and thighs. It’s the pinnacle of
comfort and performance.

&#35;&#35;&#35; Features

  * **A-Lock Engineering:** S9 racingFit system comprising new textiles and technologies working in harmony to stabilize the shorts and secure the insert in place.
  * **Butterfly Pattern:** The primary textile panel fully wrapping the lower back and legs, coming together in the rear. Fewer seams leads to a more uniform hold, less weight, and greater comfort.
  * **Type.701kompressor:** A patented woven textile developed specifically for compressive hold and second-skin comfort. 160g/m2, UPF 50+, dyed-through yarns with infused odorControl, maximum abrasion-resistance, friction reduction, hydrophobicity, and heat management. Tuned elongation in front panel for added comfort.
  * **ergoBox:** A square pattern construction that effectively frames the insert in the back, boxing it in for added stability.
  * **Carbon Xbib:** A single section of elastic material—folded over on itself—forming a supportive A-frame that delivers limited vertical stretch in the rear. Above the “X” junction, a more flexible material is employed, incorporating an antibacterial carbon weave, to wick moisture and lay flat in the front.
  * **zeroWaist:** A raw-cut, tape-reinforced edge for the smoothest transition possible between the body and fabric panel. More comfort with less pressure.
  * **Ultralight Leg Grippers:** A light silicon treatment woven into the leg bands, which reduces fabric bulk and secures the shorts in place without any excessive pressure.
  * **30% Seam Reduction:** Flatter seams throughout, with fewer overall, translates to more comfort and lower overall weight (160g).
  * **mod.Dep S9 Basalt:** Antibacterial microfiber booster top sheet in 3D basalt colorway. Pays homage to the lava stone that gives us strength, stability, and courage.
  * **superAir microShock foam:** A lightweight open cell foam with a shock absorbing composition that returns to its original position, filling the gap every time pedaling position is changed in the saddle through the shift of weight.
  * **3D waffle:** A patented, three-layer perforated foam that increases breathability and eliminates excess weight.
  * **Surface Reduction Design:** Insert footprint reduced from previous Equipe Evo pattern to shed extra grams.
  * **goldenGate:** A patented technology that interrupts the stitching along both of the insert’s side panels, allowing a more three-dimensional freedom of movement in this sensitive, rotational area.
  * **Horizontal Stabilizer:** a patented central stitch that secures the rear of the insert to the outer textile, eliminating shifting while pedaling out of the saddle.
  * **kraterCooler:** System of small holes in the front of the insert that increases airflow so that your sensitive areas are kept cooler.
