&#35;&#35;&#35; The ultimate all-day bib

For the longest days in the saddle, accept nothing but the highest level of
performance from your bibs. The Mille GTO C2 bib shorts are Assos’ ultimate
long distance, comfort-oriented bib shorts, with next-level features
throughout to keep you rolling in luxurious comfort. The Mille GTO C2 chamois
insert is the most plush in the Assos lineup, with multiple foam layers of
varying densities to absorb micro vibrations, while the sunDeck front section
comfortably accommodates your body’s anatomy. The whirlKrater design optimizes
airflow through the insert to moderate temperatures during hard efforts, and
stitch-free GoldenGate side panels help to reduce friction and skin
abrasions—keeping you comfortable during the most grueling of rides. The
fabric panels contour around your body with an ideal amount of compression to
keep you fresh, and raw edge grippers keep the bibs securely in place without
creating hotspots. The Mille GTO C2 bib shorts are designed to be limitless,
to help you find your own limits.
