&#35;&#35;&#35; FOR THE RECREATIONAL RIDER

Riding the trails can be a freeing feeling. You can escape from the city and
experience the joys of riding in nature. The Marin Bolinas Ridge 1 29" Bike is
designed for entry-level riders who want to get out on the fireroads and
doubletracks. It has a 6061 aluminum frame that has a low standover height and

rough terrain with ease.

This version of the Marin Bolinas Ridge comes with a 3x7-speed Shimano Tourney
drivetrain. The gearing is perfect for steep hills and long fireroads. Power
CX7 mechanical disc brakes provide excellent stopping power that works well in
various conditions. With the Marin double-wall alloy rims, you'll be able to
ride over rocks and bumps with confidence.
