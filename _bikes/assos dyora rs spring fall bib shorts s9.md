&#35;&#35;&#35; The ultimate versatile cold weather bib short

The Dyora RS Spring Fall Bib Shorts are perfectly-suited for shoulder season
rides, or for pairing with leg warmers to knock out those winter training
miles. The highly-insulated OSMOS Heavy fabric used on these bib shorts
features an exceptionally soft, brushed fleece interior for against-the-skin
comfort, keeping you rolling comfortably in cooler temperatures. The Dyora RS
chamois insert utilizes Superair Microshock foam, which is designed to rebound
quickly when the rider shifts their weight into a different position, as well
as a microfiber top sheet for additional comfort. GoldenGate chamois design
allows for the middle portion of the chamois insert to shift with the rider,
maintaining optimal positioning during hard rides. The Assos Dyora RS Spring
Fall bib shorts are a comfortable, versatile piece to expand your riding
season. Pair them with Assos leg warmers for the ultimate cold weather kit.

&#35;&#35;&#35; Features

  * **OSMOS Heavy material** is heavily insulated and features a brushed inner surface for added comfort
  * **Newly-updated Lycra leg band** keeps a secure, comfortable grip without the use of a silicone gripper
  * **Medium compression** keeps your legs fresh during long cold weather rides
  * **GoldenGate** insert design reduces side seams on the insert, and allows for the chamois to float with the rider
  * **Dyora RS chamois** features Superair Microshock foam and 3D waffling for quick material rebounding when the rider shifts their weight
  * **S9 Race Fit design** creates a more stable platform when pedaling, keeping the chamois in place and securing the short during high-intensity rides
