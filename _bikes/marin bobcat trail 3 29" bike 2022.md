&#35;&#35;&#35; The Aggressive Single Track Rider

The Bobcat Trail family crosses boundaries between Trail and Sport mountain
bikes. The Bobcat Trail 3 is designed for the hardtail enthusiast looking for
a full-featured trail mountain bike that doesn't break the bank. Long, low,
and slack trail geometry coupled with a 120mm suspension fork, a lightweight
Series 2 aluminum frame, and the wide-range drivetrain make the Bobcat Trail
the complete mountain bike package capable of tackling real singletrack. The
Bobcat's 29" wheels offer great roll-over performance giving you a smooth ride
no matter how rough the trail gets.

The 3 version of the Marin Bobcat Trail comes with a Shimano Altus 2x8-speed
drivetrain. The gearing is perfect for all-day adventures and moderate to
steep hill climbing. Tektro HD-M275 hydraulic disc brakes provide reliable
stopping power so you can descend under control and ride in various conditions
with ease. With the Marin Aluminum Double-Wall Rims and MTB tires, you'll have
excellent traction no matter where you go.
