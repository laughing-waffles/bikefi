&#35;&#35;&#35; GETTING A GOOD GRADE

Gravel riding has become one of the most popular genres in the bike world.
With a gravel bike, you'll be able to keep riding when the pavement ends and
the dirt trail begins. The GT Grade Expert 700c Bike is designed to take you
on all-new adventures. It has an aluminum frame and a carbon fork. The frame
features a Triple Triangle design with floating seat stays. The frame also has
external routing, a BSA 73mm BB, and flat mount disc brakes.

The Expert version of the GT Grade comes with a Shimano Tiagra/GRX400
2x10-speed drivetrain. The gearing is perfect for moderate hills and all-day
adventures. Shimano Tiagra hydraulic disc brakes provide excellent stopping
power so you can ride in various conditions with ease. With the WTB ST i23 TCS
rims and WTB Riddler TCS Light tires, you'll be able to set everything
tubeless for a smoother ride, better traction, and fewer flats.
