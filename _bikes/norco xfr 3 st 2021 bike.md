&#35;&#35;&#35; Taking On The Adventures You Encounter

Many people just getting into riding want a highly versatile bike. With a
hybrid-style bike, you'll be able to ride the pavement with ease and keep
going when there are dirt trails. The Norco XFR 3 ST Bike is a multi-terrain
bike with tires that roll fast on a variety of surfaces. It has a comfortable
X6 aluminum step-thru frame that uses 80mm of travel on the front. The XFR has
disc brakes on the front and rear and features internal cable routing to keep
things looking clean.

The XFR 3 ST comes with a Shimano 3x7-speed drivetrain. The gearing is perfect
for around the town, dirt, and moderate hills. Mechanical disc brakes provide
reliable stopping power so you ride in dusty and wet conditions with ease.
With the WTB SX19 double-wall aluminum rims and the Kenda Fast Rolling 700x50c
tires, you'll roll smoothly on the pavement and still have the traction you
need to ride on the hardpack dirt trails.
