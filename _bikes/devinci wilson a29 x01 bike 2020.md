&#35;&#35;&#35; THE FLAGSHIP DH RIDE

If you're the type of rider who enjoys the thrill of the descent and would
rather take a lift back to the top, then you'll want a downhill bike. DH bikes
are durable, nimble, and have long travel so they can navigate the toughest
descents. The Devinci Wilson A29 X01 Bike has a lightweight, yet durable
aluminum front triangle and carbon seat stays for responsive performance. The
frame is compatible with up to 2.5" tires, has a low standover height, carbon
bash plate, an adjustable geometry flip-chip, and Split Pivot suspension that
separates acceleration forces from braking forces.

The X01 version of the Devinci Wilson A29 comes with a SRAM X01 DH 7-speed
drivetrain. SRAM Code RSC hydraulic disc brakes provide excellent stopping
power so you can descend with confidence. Race Face Atlas 30 Heavy Duty wheels
are paired with Maxxis Minion tires that have a DH casing and can be set up
tubeless for a smoother ride, better traction, and fewer flats. With the
RockShox BoXXer Ultimate RC2 fork and RockShox Super Deluxe Coil Ultimate DH
rear suspension, you'll be able to roll over everything in your path with
ease.
