&#35;&#35;&#35; The Bike Path Rider

Whether you're going out for your morning ride, commuting to work, or just
cruising on the bike paths, you'll want a comfortable bike to ride on. With
flat bars and a comfortable frame geometry, the Marin Fairfax 3 Bike is here
for your every need. It has a lightweight aluminum frame that uses a full
carbon fork. The frame features internal cable routing, flat-mount disc
brakes, and has rack, fender, and kickstand mounts which allow you to easily
transform this into your daily commuter.

The Fairfax 3 comes with a MicroSHIFT/Shimano 2x9-speed drivetrain. The
gearing is perfect for moderate hills and longer rides. Tektro R290 hydraulic
disc brakes provide excellent stopping power so you can ride in wet conditions
and descend with ease. With the Marin aluminum double-wall rims and Vee Tire
Baldy tires with puncture protection, you'll be able to ride with confidence
knowing you have highly durable wheels and tires.
