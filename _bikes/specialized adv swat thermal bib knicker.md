&#35;&#35;&#35; Offseason? What offseason?

The Specialized Adventure SWAT Thermal Bib Knickers expand the capability of
your standard thermal knickers, and are designed for those epic winter
adventure rides when the temperatures are less than favorable. The knicker
design extends far enough to cover your knees, protecting your joints from the
biting cold. Patented SWAT technology expands your capability to carry all you
need to extend your ride. With three hanging rear pockets, it allows
convenient, comfortable and stable storage of ride essentials—no need to
overstuff your jersey pockets on a long ride. Zippered side leg pockets keep
small items handy. Insulated, versatile, comfortable and practical, the
Specialized Adv SWAT Thermal Bib Knickers just might be your next favorite
cold weather bibs.

&#35;&#35;&#35; Features

  * **Knicker length** covers your knees, keeping your joints warm and protected
  * **SWAT technology** for the ultimate storage solution
  * **Body Geometry 3D contour chamois** with triple density foam for all-day comfort
  * **Wind and water-resistant** to keep you warm and dry
