&#35;&#35;&#35; NO PAIN, ALL GAIN

E-Bikes are growing in popularity because they help riders climb to new
heights and push the boundaries of what they are capable of. Pedal-assist
bikes can easily be turned off for those times when you don't need it and
turned back on for those tougher climbs or rougher rides. The Orbea Gain M30
Bike was designed to enhance your die, not dominate it. The Gain has a carbon
fiber frame with flat-mount disc brakes. The Ebikemotion X35 motor and the
integrated battery are hidden away inside the frame. The frame has ample tire
clearance so you can run up to 700x40c tires for ultimate comfort on rough
pavement.

The M30 version of the Orbea Gain comes with a Shimano 105 R7000 2x11-speed
drivetrain. The Shimano 105 R7000 cassette has an excellent 11-32-tooth gear
range that makes climbing hills a little easier while not sacrificing top-end
speed. Shimano R7070 hydraulic disc brakes provide confidence-inspiring
stopping power so you can descend down anything and ride in bad weather with
ease. Mavic Aksium Elite Disc UST wheels are paired with Mavic Yksion Pro
700x28c UST tires. Both are tubeless so you can reduce the tire pressure for a
smoother ride, better traction, and fewer flats thanks to the tubeless sealant
you would use.
