&#35;&#35;&#35; A versatile cold weather ride companion

When the weather is unpredictable, having a packable windproof outer layer is
critical. The Ranger Wind Jacket is a self-contained cold weather powerhouse.
It’s packable down into its own interior pocket, letting you stash it away in
a pocket or hip pack when it’s not needed. The Ranger Wind Jacket is ready for
any weather, with a high level of wind resistance, and a DWR treatment to
allow the jacket to shed water in case the skies open up. 4-way stretch
material provides a comfortable fit and helps to keep cold drafts at bay, and
a knit jersey fabric panel on the rear adds more breathability. Secure
zippered front hand pockets keep your items right where you need them.
Convenient, high-performing coverage for when the weather just won’t
cooperate, the Ranger Wind Vest is a must-have for cold weather riding.
