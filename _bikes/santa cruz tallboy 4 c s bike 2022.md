&#35;&#35;&#35; The Gravity Rider's XC Bike

When it comes to trail riding, you'll want a bike that is highly capable while
still remaining lightweight and stiff. Trail bikes have longer travel than an
XC bike and are much more capable when it comes to aggressive riding. The
Santa Cruz Tallboy 4 C S Bike takes a leap further into what short-travel
bikes really are capable of. It has a Carbon C frame that uses VPP suspension,
120mm of travel on the rear, and 130mm of travel on the front. The frame
features internal cable routing and integrated frame protection.

The S version of the Santa Cruz Tallboy 4 C comes with a SRAM GX Eagle
12-speed drivetrain. This includes a cassette that has a hill-crushing 10-52T
gear range that makes climbing and pedaling through rough terrain a breeze.
SRAM G2 R hydraulic disc brakes provide excellent stopping power so you can
descend under control. Race Face AR Offset 30 29" rims are paired with Maxxis
tires that can be set up tubeless for a smoother ride, better traction, and
fewer flats. With the RockShox Reverb Stealth Dropper Post, you'll be able to
quickly lift and lower your saddle with the press of a lever.
