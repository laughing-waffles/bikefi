&#35;&#35;&#35; Do-it-All (City) Shredder

The Big Block has long been All-City’s do-it-all city shredder, bombproof
commuter, and near indestructible track bike for years. Its 612 Select Cromoly
steel frame strikes a solid balance of weight, durability, and comfort. The
fixed gear (or single speed) drivetrain keeps maintenance as simple as
possible, making the Big Block a terrific commuter bike or general purpose
bike for riders who like to spend as little time as possible working on their
own bikes. Modern fixed gear geometry paired with the lively and springy
nature of the Cromoly steel frame results in a nimble bike that dances up
climbs and weaves through city streets. Tire clearance for up to 32c tires (or
28c with fenders) gives you the option to run your favorite wider tires for
when the weather gets rough and the streets are tough. The lugged fork crown
adds a touch of class and style and pairs perfectly with the classic style of
the Big Block. A full E.D. coating and liquid paint ensures that the frame
will look terrific and sparkle for years to come while keeping rust at bay.

For the complete Big Block build, All-City went with their in-house All-City
612 Track Cranks. The 612 Track Cranks are plenty stiff for sprinting around
town or for the occasional track race. They come in a 165mm length
configuration which is a must for cornering on a fixed gear. The 46t chainring
features a track standard 144bcd, which allows you to easily swap out the
chainring for just about any track chainring on the market. The 46t chainring
in conjunction with the 17t cog provides a solid gearing ratio that’s perfect
for city mashing where starting and stopping quickly is key. Wheels are ever-
reliable Alex DH19 32h rims laced to smooth JoyTech A566 hubs. Wrapped around
the rims are a set of incredibly durable 28mm Vittoria Zaffiros IV tires. The
all AL6061 alloy cockpit is supplied by JD components with the bars coming in
at a wide 720mm width for maximum control and leverage. Whether you’re
conquering the streets or lining up at the velodrome, the All-City Big Block
can do it all.
