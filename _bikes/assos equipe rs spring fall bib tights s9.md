&#35;&#35;&#35; Race-ready, cold-resistant

The lightly-insulated OSMOS Light fabric used on the Equipe RS Spring Fall
bibs features a compressive fit for long hard efforts in the saddle and a
brushed interior for against-the-skin comfort to keep you rolling comfortably
in cooler temperatures. The Equipe RS chamois insert utilizes 9mm of Superair
Microshock foam, which is designed to rebound quickly when the rider shifts
their weight into a different position. GoldenGate chamois design allows for
the middle portion of the chamois insert to shift with the rider, maintaining
optimal positioning during hard rides. The Assos Equipe RS Spring Fall bibs
are perfect for keeping up with your high-intensity training or racing in
cooler months.

&#35;&#35;&#35; Features

  * **OSMOS Light material** is lightly insulated and features a brushed inner surface for added comfort
  * **OSMOS Medium fabric overlay** at the front of the bibs keeps cold air at bay while maintaining breathability
  * **GoldenGate** insert design reduces side seams on the insert, and allows for the chamois to float with the rider
  * **Equipe RS chamois** features 9mm of Superair Microshock foam and 3D waffling for quick material rebounding when the rider shifts their weight
