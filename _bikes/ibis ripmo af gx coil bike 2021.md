&#35;&#35;&#35; JUST METAL AF

Sometimes it can be difficult to improve upon something that is already great.
When it comes to the Ibis Ripmo, Ibis made it a little slacker, a little
longer, and made it more progressive and coil compatible. The Ibis Ripmo AF GX
Coil Bike is built for fun out on the trails with 29" wheels, 160mm of travel
on the front, and 147mm of travel on the rear. The aluminum frame has modern
geometry for excellent performance, has tons of space for longer dropper
posts, has tire clearance for up to 2.6" tires, and features internal cable
routing, and a removable ISCG mount.

The GX version of the Ibis Ripmo AF comes with a SRAM GX Eagle 1x12-speed
drivetrain. The cassette on the rear has a hill-crushing 10-52T gear range
that makes climbing and riding in rough terrain a breeze. SRAM Code RSC
hydraulic disc brakes provide excellent stopping power so you can descend with
confidence. Ibis S35 aluminum wheels are paired with Maxxis Assegai tires that
can be set up tubeless for a smoother ride, better traction, and fewer flats.
With the Bike Yoke Revive dropper, you'll be able to quickly lift and lower
your saddle without needing to dismount your bike.
