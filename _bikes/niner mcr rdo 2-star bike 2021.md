&#35;&#35;&#35; The Magic Carpet Ride

Suspension used to just be for mountain bikes. Now you can find front and rear
suspension on a gravel bike. This means you'll be able to ride faster, go
farther, and stay out on the trails longer. The Niner MCR RDO 2-Star Bike is
built with 50mm of CVA suspension that gives you confidence, comfort, and
control on the trails and gravel. The carbon RDO frame has wide tire clearance
for up to 700 x 50mm or 650b x 2.0" tires. The frame also features an
integrated fender, internal cable routing, and integrated frame mounts for
bottles and bags. This MCR comes with a Fox 32 SC Float AX Performance Elite
fork with 40mm of travel and an X-Fusion MicroLite RL rear shock.

The 2-Star version of the Niner MCR comes with a SRAM Apex 1 11-speed
drivetrain. This includes an ultra-wide cassette that has an 11-42T gear range
that makes climbing and pedaling through rough terrain a breeze. SRAM Apex 1
HRD brakes provide excellent stopping power so you can descend and ride in wet
conditions with confidence. Niner Alloy rims are paired with Schwalbe G-One
Allround tires that can be set up tubeless for a smoother ride, better
traction, and fewer flats.
