&#35;&#35;&#35; The Dedicated Commuter

Whether you're commuting to work, cruising the bike paths, or you're just
riding to get some morning coffee, you'll want a comfortable bike to ride on.
The Marin Presidio 1 700c Bike is designed with low maintenance and
adaptability in mind. It has a Series 1 Fitness butted and formed aluminum
frame and a lightweight aluminum fork. The frame features internal/external
cable routing, rack and fender mounts so you can easily transform this into
your daily commuter, disc brakes, and water bottle mounts.

The 1 version of the Marin Presidio comes with a MicroSHIFT/Shimano 8-speed
drivetrain. The gearing is perfect for rides around the city and commutes to
work while your bike is loaded down with all your gear. Tektro HD-M275
hydraulic disc brakes provide excellent stopping power so you can descend with
confidence and ride in wet conditions with ease. With the Marin aluminum
double-wall rims and the Marin Fitness tires, you'll have a smooth and durable
ride everywhere you go.
