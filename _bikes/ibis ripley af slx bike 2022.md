&#35;&#35;&#35; The Category Defier

Trail bikes are great at many things. Whether you enjoy long climbs, fast
descents, or technical single track, you'll love to ride a trail bike. The
Ibis Ripley AF SLX Bike is a singletrack-scorching bike that has a more
aggressive geometry. It has an aluminum frame that uses 130mm of travel on the
front and 120mm of travel on the rear. The frame uses DW-Link Suspension that
is responsive and plush, has clearance for longer dropper posts, and features
a removable ISCG-05 mount and tire clearance for up to 2.6" tires.

The SLX version of the Ibis Ripley AF comes with a Shimano SLX 12-speed
drivetrain. This includes a cassette that has a hill-crushing 10-51T gear
range that makes climbing and pedaling through rough terrain a breeze. Shimano
SLX hydraulic disc brakes provide excellent stopping power so you can descend
under control. Ibis S35 aluminum wheels are paired with Maxxis tires that can
be set up tubeless for a smoother ride, better traction, and fewer flats. With
the Bike Yoke Revive Dropper Post, you'll be able to quickly lift and lower
your saddle with the press of a lever.
