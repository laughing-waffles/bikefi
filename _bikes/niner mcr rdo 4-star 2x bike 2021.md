&#35;&#35;&#35; A Magic Carpet Ride

Yes, your eyes aren’t deceiving you, that’s a full suspension gravel bike.
Niner has spent the last few years optimizing their class leading CVA
suspension platform for small high-frequency impacts. The result? A suspension
platform perfectly tuned for modern gravel riding. With a full suspension
platform you’ll be more confident while descending, more comfortable on
bumpier sections, and have increased traction on the climbs. When the dirt
turns to pavement you can easily lock out the suspension with a push of a
button, effectively turning the MCR into a rigid gravel bike. An integrated
rear fender keeps mud and grime off of and out of the rear shock, increasing
the longevity of the rear shock. The lightweight Niner RDO carbon fiber frame
keeps the bike feeling lightweight and agile while putting the power down.
Tire clearance for up to 700x50c or 650bx2.0” tires means you can run your
favorite tire combination. 11 fixed mounting points let you bring just about
any bag or bottle combination under the sun. Fully integrated internal dropper
post support gives you the option to get extra rowdy on the descents and
technical singletrack.

For the 4-Star build Niner decided to go with the fan favorite Shimano GRX800
2x11-speed for the drivetrain and brakes. The GRX800 drivetrain offers a
reliable and crisp shifting with a wide range of gears to help you tackle the
toughest climbs and the steepest descents. Paired up with the GRX800
drivetrain are the ultra lightweight and incredibly stiff Easton EC90 carbon
cranks. GRX800 hydraulic brakes stop on a dime, are consistently powerful
while also offering excellent modulation, and are easy to bleed. Suspension up
front is handled by the ever popular FOX 32 SC AX Performance Elite fork in a
40mm travel configuration paired with the very tuneable FIT4 damper. The FIT4
damper eliminates small bumps and washboard chatter. Suspension out back is a
X-Fusion Microlite which has been tuned to deal with high frequency bumps
while also providing maximum comfort and traction over long distances.
Tubeless ready DT Swiss G1800 Spline 25’s are lightweight, accelerate quickly,
and provide a great platform for wider tires. Paired with the DT Swiss wheels
are a set of Schwalbe G-One Allround Evo tires in 700x38c, these tires strike
the perfect balance of speed, suppleness, and grip making them the perfect
multi surface tire. As for the finishing kit it’s handled by both Niner and
Easton.
