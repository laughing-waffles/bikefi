&#35;&#35;&#35; The Comfy Commuter Bike

Whether you're commuting to work by bike, cruising the bike paths, or you're
seeing where the gravel roads lead, you'll want a highly versatile bike to
ride on. With an E-bike, you'll be able to ride farther and conquer many of
the obstacles that once held you back. The Marin Sausalito E1 E-Bike is an
E-bike with a lot of versatility, lightweight frame, and large tires for added
comfort. It has a Series 3 aluminum frame that features internal cable
routing, a kickstand, rack and fender mounts, and integrated wiring. The
Sausalito comes with a Shimano STEPS E5000 motor and Shimano 418Wh battery.

The E1 version of the Marin Sausalito comes with a Shimano Deore 4100 10-speed
drivetrain. This includes a cassette with an ultra-wide-range 11-46T gear
range that makes climbing a breeze, even without the motor assisting. Tektro
hydraulic disc brakes provide excellent stopping power in various weather
conditions. With the Marin aluminum double-wall rims and WTB Horizon tires,
you'll have a smooth ride over any surface.
