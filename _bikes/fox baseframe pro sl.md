&#35;&#35;&#35; Low profile body armor

With each passing season, mountain biking technology progresses further by
making bikes lighter and faster and our equipment more capable, in return,
allowing us to ride faster and go bigger than ever before. However, this also
means accidents and crashes will be more prevalent, resulting in injuries. To
combat this, Fox partnered with D3O® to design safety equipment specifically
tailored to riders who love to shred the trails. Introducing the Fox Baseframe
Pro SL body armor, a low profile protective base layer that is designed to fit
underneath your jersey. Featuring D3O world leading impact protection
technology, the Baseframe Pro SL has a D3O back insert for protection in case
of a crash. Built in padding at the hips has also been added for additional
protection. The entire base layer is made of moisture wicking, open stretch
mesh for breathability and comfort.

&#35;&#35;&#35; Features

  * **CE Certified D3O® back insert** Impact protection technology for your back.
  * **Comfort** Moisture wicking, open stretch mesh for breathability.
  * **Padding** Built in padding at hips offers additional protection.
