&#35;&#35;&#35; TOP OF THE PODIUM

Hardtails are a great option for riders looking for a lightweight XC or trail
bike. These bikes are able to climb exceptionally well and descend with
confidence. The Norco Revolver HT 2 120 29" Bike is designed to carry cross
country racers to the top of the podium. It has a carbon XC race frame that
has a Ride Aligned design system. The frame features internal cable routing,
uses 120mm of travel on the front, and is dropper post compatible.

The HT 2 version of the Norco Revolver comes with a Shimano SLX/XT 12-speed
drivetrain. This includes a cassette that has a hill-crushing 10-51T gear
range that makes climbing and pedaling through rough terrain a breeze. Shimano
Deore 4-piston hydraulic disc brakes provide excellent stopping power so you
can descend with confidence. Stan's Arch S1 rims are paired with Schwalbe
Nobby Nic Evo tires that can be set up tubeless for a smoother ride, better
traction, and fewer flats. With the X-Fusion Manic Dropper Post, you'll be
able to quickly lift and lower your saddle with the press of a lever.
