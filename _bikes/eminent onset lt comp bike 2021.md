Known for their futuristic frame designs, Eminent is a fairy new cycling
company that have made a name for themselves with their unique style of bikes
and top-of-the-line quality and performance. The Eminent Onset LT is Eminent’s
mid-travel 29’er that was designed for speed, versatility and agility on the
descents and can still deliver top-notch climbing performance. The Onset LT
shares the same AFS suspension technology as its shorter and longer-travel
siblings but in an aggressive all-mountain frame design. The balanced
suspension kinematics combined with the square tubing makes for an ultra-stiff
frame that has perfect anti-squat characteristics. A 66-degree headtube angle,
paired together with a 76-degree seat tube angle, makes for an aggressive
mountain bike that is eager to rip down technical single-track but still able
to conquer climbs with ease. For the finishing touches, the unidirectional
carbon fiber frame has internal cable routing, integrated ISCG05 mounts, a
carbon downtube protector and an integrated seat clamp and for a clean-looking
and efficient design.

The Comp build of the Eminent Onset LT features a Shimano 12-speed drivetrain,
a complete Cane Creek suspension set and Crankbrothers Synthesis Enduro
wheels. The Shimano SLX, 12-speed drivetrain provides an impressive 10-51
tooth gear range for confidence getting up any hill. When it is time to send
it down, the Cane Creek Helm, 150mm fork and the Double barrel Aire, 140mm
travel inline rear shock have you covered with premium suspension performance.
When you need to slow down fast, you can trust the Shimano’s Deore, 4-piston
brakes to supply adequate stopping power. For a premium mountain-shredding
wheelset, Eminent stuck the Onset LT with Crankbrothers Synthesis Enduro 29”
wheels paired together with knobby Vittoria tires.
