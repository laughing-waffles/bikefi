&#35;&#35;&#35; Primed For The Adventure Ahead

Mountain biking has come a long way from the suspensionless, steel-framed
bikes back in the day. Mountain biking today is down to a science and these
bikes are capable of exceeding expectations. The Intense Primer 29 GX Eagle
Jenson USA Exclusive Build is evolved from excellence and is true to the trail
providing outstanding performance. The Primer 29 has a brand new fully-carbon
frame that has a new JS Trail Link system that offers exceptional performance
on mixed terrain with its ideal curve through the travel. This means it'll
perform well pedaling uphill and on long descents. The frame has ISCG05
mounts, Flak guard armor for enhanced frame protection, a threaded bottom
bracket, and internal cable routing.

This Jenson USA Exclusive build comes expertly spec'd with a SRAM GX Eagle
12-speed drivetrain. This includes a cassette that has a hill-crushing 10-52T
gear range that makes climbing and riding in rough terrain a breeze. Magura
MT5 HC hydraulic disc brakes provide excellent stopping power so you can
descend with confidence and control. Crank Brothers Synthesis Enduro Alloy
wheels are paired with Kenda Hellkat 29" tires that can be set up tubeless for
a smoother ride, better traction, and fewer flats. With the PNW Rainier
Dropper Post, you'll be able to quickly lift and lower your saddle without
needing to dismount.
