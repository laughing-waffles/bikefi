&#35;&#35;&#35; Steel is Real, Real Fun

The Pine Mountain is taking hardtail adventure and trail riding to the next
level featuring a classic steel frame and large volume 29+ tires. The wider
plus-sized tires provide increased traction and control because they produce a
larger contact patch with the ground than a traditional-sized tire. The
enlarged tire also has an outer circumference that is larger than a standard
29” tire, which means it has even better roll-over characteristics. With 29+,
you received unparalleled traction and exceptional roll-over. The Pine
Mountain features trail-ready geometry and a wide-range 1x drivetrain making
it worthy of any epic trail adventure. It’s time to get out and explore with
the Marin Pine Mountain.

The Pine Mountain 2 is an incredible bike coming in at a great price-point. A
Rock Shox RS 35 fork provides a supple and smooth ride, the Shimano SLX 1x12
drivetrain provides all the gears you need to make it up the steepest climbs,
and Shimano hydraulic disc brakes provide incredible stopping power when
descending those steep chutes. The bike is rounded out with Marin Tubeless
Ready wheels for less flats and incredible traction.

If you are looking for a bike that can handle everything the trail has to
offer, the Marin Pine Mountain needs to be your next ride. From fast flowy
single track to all day bike-packing adventures and everything in between, the
Pine Mountain was designed to handle it all. Push your riding further and
explore with more confidence than ever before.

[MTBR](https://reviews.mtbr.com/five-bikes-wed-rather-own-and-cost-less-than-an-iphone-x) \- _" The Pine Mountain is a gorgeous steel hard tail that pays
homage to the brands past, but incorporates modern amenities. Rolling on plus-
sized tires, a wide range 1x by drive train, and smart value-oriented
components, this is the perfect bike for all-day trail rides and bikepacking
adventures."_

[VeloAcier.com](http://www.veloacier.com/marin-bikes-pine-mountain-2018/) \-
_" The PINE MOUNTAIN family is definitely oriented and designed for adventure,
and is perfectly suited to long treks over several days."_

[NMSB.com](https://nsmb.com/articles/2018-marin-pine-mountain-1/) \- _" A
solid good looking bike that will leave cash in your wallet for upgrades or
sweet riding trips. Do you know of a chromoly hardtail that would challenge
the Pine Mountain 1 for the belt at a fighting weight under 1.3k? If so let us
know."_
