&#35;&#35;&#35; Comfort and Warmth For Your Ride

When the temperatures begin to drop, you'll want to wear your thermal cycling
apparel so you can ride comfortably. Having a good set of bibtights will let
you ride in the cold without limiting your range of motion. The Endura Pro SL
Bibtights II are made with a 4-way high-stretch windproof, breathable fabric
with a DWR finish to repel water. The tights also have luxurious Thermoroubaix
panels with DWR M treatment that provide insulation, comfort, and water
repellency. They feature a 700 Series pad that makes longer rides more
comfortable, rear-facing reflectivity on the ankles, and supportive cozy-touch
mesh upper with high-stretch Lycra bound straps.
