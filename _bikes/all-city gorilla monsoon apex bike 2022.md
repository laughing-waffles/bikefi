&#35;&#35;&#35; Monster Cross = Monster Fun

All-City bikes are fun, plain-and-simple. They’re made to go anywhere, do
anything, and put a smile on your face while you’re riding them. For the
Gorilla Monsoon, All City used their classic recipe of two parts steel and one
big cup of fun, but added in a special blend of one part tire clearance and a
splash of rowdiness. In the classic All-City fashion, the Gorilla Monsoon is
built around a sporty 612 select tubing steel frame for maximum durability and
that springy ride quality that only steel offers. Its comfortable geometry
makes it a very stable platform, resulting in a confidence inspiring ride.
Wide tire clearance for up to 27.5x2.4” (or 700x42mm) lets you explore with
full on mountain bike tires and allows you to run a plethora of tire choices.
Modern features like internal dropper post routing, flat mount brakes, and
12mm thru axles ensures that the Gorilla Monsoon is plenty futureproof.
Integrated fenders and rack mounts let you turn it into a bad weather
commuter, bikepackers dream machine, or even just a super rad grocery getter.
All-City’s attention to detail doesn’t go unnoticed with additional touches
like E.D. coating to protect against rust, liquid paint for a long lasting
paint job, lugged fork for a touch of nostalgia, and reinforced bottle bosses
because, well, why not? If we were to summarize the Gorilla Monsoon we would
say it’s the cycling industry leader in fun.

For the APEX level build, All-City went with the ever reliable SRAM APEX
1x11-speed drivetrain. The 11-42T cassette paired with the 38T chainring on
the FSA Comet crankset provides an excellent range of gears fit for everything
from bikepacking exploration to quick singletrack rips and everything in
between. Braking is handled by a set of Tektro mechanical disc brakes, which
are easy to adjust and offer reliable braking performance. If we direct our
attention to the seatpost you’ll find a TranzX dropper with 50mm of travel.
50mm of travel may not sound like a lot, but it’s quite perfect for most
gravel and adventure riding where shifting your weight back and around the
bike gives you a boost of confidence and allows you to ride more terrain
quicker and with more control. For wheels, All-City went with a set of WTB ST
i25 tubeless rims laced to a set of easy to service Novatec hubs. This
combination translates into a reliable tubeless wheelset that’s ready to take
on any challenge. For tires you’ll find a set of tubeless WTB Riddler’s in a
27.5x2.4” configuration wrapped around the rims. These tires come in the
light/fast casing option which when paired with the excellent all-around tire
tread of the Riddler promises a fast and grippy experience that’s perfect for
a variety of riding scenarios.
