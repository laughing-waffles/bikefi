&#35;&#35;&#35; COMFORTABLE TRANSPORT

More and more each day, people are choosing to leave their vehicles behind at
home and riding their bikes to work instead. Riding your bike to school or
work can help boost your mood and energy. The Marin Kentfield 2 700c Bike is
designed for commuting, tackling the bike paths, and riding to your local
coffee shop. It features a 6061 aluminum frame that has fender and rack mounts
so you can easily carry your gear and ride in wet conditions without getting
splashed. The frame also features a hybrid geometry with an upright seated
position.

The Marin Kentfield 2 comes with a 10-speed MicroSHIFT drivetrain with an
ultra-wide-range 11-51T gear range that makes climbing much easier. Power CX7
mechanical disc brakes provide excellent stopping power that works well in
various conditions. With the Marin double-wall alloy rims, you'll be able to
ride over bumps and rough roads with confidence.
