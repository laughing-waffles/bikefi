&#35;&#35;&#35; A TRUE SECOND-SKIN FITTING

Whether you're racing to the podium, riding a century, or you're just cruising
around town, you're going to want comfortable cycling shorts. Not all
bibshorts are created equally, so make sure you get the one that matches your
style of riding. The ALE R-EV1 Pro Race Bibshort with 8-Hour Shammy has an
innovative pattern with fewer cuts and stitching that can grant the best
muscle support. It has strategically modeled Bonded Technology at the leg hem
that keeps the bibshort stable on the body without any restriction. It
features reflective logos that help increase your visibility in low-light
conditions and it features an 8-hour chamois that has protection wings and a
relief channel.
