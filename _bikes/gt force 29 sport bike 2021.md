&#35;&#35;&#35; For Those Twisty Trails

If you're looking for an aggressive mountain bike to tackle those steep
descents and twisty trails, you'll want to look at getting an enduro bike.
Enduro bikes are perfect for aggressive riding and can climb back to the top
when you're done descending. The GT Force 29" Sport Bike is a long-travel 29"
bike that is perfect for any terrain you put in front of it. The aluminum
frame has 160mm of travel on the front and 150mm of travel on the rear. The
frame features a BSA bottom bracket, Boost spacing, and LockR Pivots.

The Sport version of the GT Force 29" Bike comes with a Shimano Deore 11-speed
drivetrain. This includes a cassette that has a hill-crushing 11-51T gear
range that makes climbing and pedaling through rough terrain a breeze. Tektro
M275 hydraulic disc brakes provide reliable stopping power so you can descend
under control. WTB STX i29 TCS rims are paired with Maxxis Minion tires that
can be set up tubeless for a smoother ride, better traction, and fewer flats.
With the TranzX Dropper Post, you'll be able to quickly lift and lower your
saddle with the press of a lever.
