description: "&#35;&#35; Assos Mille GT Bib Shorts

The Assos Mille GT Bib Shorts allow you to train, race and simply ride in
total comfort thanks to the custom fabric blend and celebrated insert design.
They’ve been treated with our proven Type.429 Titanio material, which is a
durable, lightly compressive textile with high elasticity, ensuring a
comfortable and consistent hold on your legs while pedaling. The Mille S7 EVO
insert has 8mm of memory foam for comfort and performance. Wide, flexible bib
straps create a Y-shape design that is flat and stable. With the reflective
accents, you'll have enhanced visibility in low-light conditions.

&#35;&#35;&#35; FEATURES

  * **Type.429 Titanio:** A comfortable, lightly compressive textile, engineered with expertise that uses a 4-way stretch to maximize the elasticity of the fabric.
  * **MILLE S7 EVO:** The MILLE elastic interface insert, evolved. New black colorway, and our proven 8mm of memory foam, this insert is nestled at the intersection between comfort and performance.
  * **kraterCooler:** System of small holes in the front of the insert that increases airflow so that your sensitive areas are kept cooler.
  * **3D waffle:** A patented, three-layer perforated foam that increases breathability and eliminates excess weight.
  * **goldenGate:** A patented technology that interrupts the stitching along both of the insert’s side panels, allowing a more three-dimensional freedom of movement in this sensitive, rotational area.
  * **Y7 Frame Carrier Bib Tech:** Wide, flexible bib straps converge at the upper back in a Y-shape design, resulting in a flat, stable structure that disappears between the shoulder blades.
  * **Stabilizator V3:** Dorsal stabilizer in a solid mesh with limited vertical stretch. Includes MILLE GT line graphics and climaCode.
  * **superFlat grippers:** Ultra minimal grippers with optimal stretch return to secure the shorts in place without any excessive pressure.
  * **zeroWaist:** A raw-cut, tape-reinforced edge for the smoothest transition possible between the body and fabric panel. More comfort with less pressure.
  * **Reflective Accents:** Small strips placed on the backs of the legs for added visibility.
  * **regularFit:** Optimized for total comfort in the riding position, with a more relaxed cut than our second-skin racingFit.
  * **Composition:** 74%PA, 18%EA, 8%PL
