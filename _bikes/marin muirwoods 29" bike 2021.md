&#35;&#35;&#35; FOR EVERYDAY ADVENTURES

Many people around the world are choosing to leave their vehicles at home and
ride their bikes instead, every day. If you're looking to commute to work by
bike or just want to explore places you wouldn't normally see in a vehicle,
then you'll want a comfortable and versatile bike. The Marin Muirwoods 29"
Bike is perfectly at home in the concrete jungle and is capable of jumping off
curbs and cutting through a park while you're riding to work or the coffee
shop. It has a Series 1 Butted CrMo Steel frame and steel fork that provide a
smooth ride. The frame has rack and fender mounts so you can easily carry all
your gear and essentials without getting splashed when riding through puddles.
The frame also features reflective graphics to enhance your visibility in low-
light conditions.

The Muirwoods comes with Shimano Altus/Alivio 3x9-speed drivetrain. The
gearing is perfect for longer rides, steep hills, and fast descents. Shimano
M201 hydraulic disc brakes provide excellent stopping power so you can descend
with confidence. The Marin Double Wall Rims are highly durable and are paired
with Vee Tire Speedster tires that offer puncture protection and have
reflective sidewalls to further enhance your visibility in low-light
conditions.
