&#35;&#35;&#35; Electrify Your Commute

Many people are choosing to leave their vehicles at home and riding their
bikes instead. E-bikes are designed to remove many of the barriers that keep
people from enjoying the world on a bike. With an E-bike, you'll be able to
commute and ride with ease. The Diamondback Union 2 Bike is built on a sleek
aluminum frame with internal cable routing. It is powered by a Bosch
Performance Line Speed motor and Powertube 500Wh battery. The frame features
thru-axles on the front and rear and has fenders, a rear rack, a rear-mounted
kickstand, and a Lezyne integrated headlight and taillight.

The Union 2 comes with a Shimano Deore 10-speed drivetrain. The gearing is
perfect for around the town while you have all your gear with you or while
riding on the bike paths. Shimano MT420 4-piston disc brakes provide excellent
stopping power so you can descend under control. With the aluminum rims and
Schwalbe Super Moto tires, you'll have a smooth ride anywhere you go.
