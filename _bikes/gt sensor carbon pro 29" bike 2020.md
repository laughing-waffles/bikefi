&#35;&#35;&#35; CONQUER EVERY LAST OBSTACLE

Trail bikes let you conquer all the terrain. They are designed to climb well
and descend confidently. The GT Sensor Carbon Pro is a modern-day trail bike
engineered to go fast, get loose, and have fun. The carbon frame utilizes
130mm of travel on the rear and 140mm of travel on the front. The frame has
LockR Pivots, a tapered head tube, Boost spacing, and ISCG05 mounts.

The Pro model of the GT Sensor Carbon comes with a SRAM X01/GX Eagle
drivetrain. The cassette on the rear has a hill-crushing 10-50T gear range
that makes climbing and riding in rough terrain much easier. The SRAM G2 RSC
hydraulic disc brakes provide excellent stopping power for confident
descending. Stan's NoTubes Flow MK3 wheels are paired with Schwalbe tires that
can be set up tubeless for a smoother ride, better traction, and fewer flats.
With the KS LEV Si dropper post, you'll be able to quickly lift and lower your
saddle without the need to dismount.
