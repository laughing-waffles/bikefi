description: "&#35;&#35; Pearl Izumi Thermal Tights

The Pearl Izumi Thermal Tights were made for those harsh winter riding days
when comfort depends on consistent warmth. To deliver a great shoulder season
riding experience, Thermal fleece fabric insulates and transfers moisture
efficiently, while PI Dry water-shedding technology wards off splashes and
light rain. Fewer panels and reduced seaming combined with a stretchier fabric
has improved both fit and comfort. These tights do not have a chamois,
allowing you to pull them over your favorite shorts or use them for other cold
weather activities.

&#35;&#35;&#35; Features

  * **Ultra-soft Thermal fleece fabric** for pedaling comfort and thermal regulation
  * **Made with recycled material** eco friendly
  * **PI Dry® technology** for permanent water-shedding performance
  * **Eliminated zippers at the ankles** for improved fit and comfort
  * **BioViz® reflective elements** for low-light visibility
