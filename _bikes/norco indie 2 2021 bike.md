&#35;&#35;&#35; Explore The Cities

Whether you're commuting to work, riding the bike paths, or exploring the
gravel roads, you'll want a comfortable bike to ride on. The Norco Indie 2
Bike is designed for those looking to escape the ordinary. It has an aluminum
frame and an aluminum fork. The frame has rack and fender mounts so you can
easily transform this into your daily commuter. The frame also features water
bottle mounts, internal cable routing, and high-volume 27.5" tires for a
smooth ride.

The Indie 2 comes with a Shimano Altus 2x8-speed drivetrain. The gearing is
perfect for longer rides and moderate hills you need to climb along the way.
Tektro M275 hydraulic disc brakes provide excellent stopping power so you can
ride with confidence. With the double-wall aluminum rims and Schwalbe Big Ben
tires, you'll have a smooth ride with highly durable tires that resist
punctures.
