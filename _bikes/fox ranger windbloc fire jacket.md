description: "&#35;&#35; Fox Ranger Windbloc® Fire Jacket

&#35;&#35;&#35; Performance for the everyday epic

Many active-casual jackets claim to be great performers on the bike, but few
actually are. The Fox Ranger Windbloc® Fire Jacket takes on-bike performance
and off-bike style to a whole new level. The jacket excels at blocking wind,
water and biting cold, while maintaining an effortless style that’s just as
well suited for post-ride hangs as all-day epics. Fox engineered Polartec®
Windbloc® fabric into the jacket at the shoulders and lower back to protect
against the weather, while the tough polyester exterior is robust enough to
handle daily wear. Brushed fleece inside keeps things toasty, and a rear drop
tail keeps you covered when worn on the bike. A pair of zippered hand pockets
and an elastic interior pocket keeps things secured.

&#35;&#35;&#35; Features

  * **Polartec® Windbloc® fabric** at the lower back and shoulders protects against the elements
  * **Drop tail** provides plenty of on-bike coverage
  * **Two zippered hand pockets and one interior pocket** make the jacket practical for daily use
  * **Elastic waist and wrist cuffs** keep the jacket in place even during intense shredding
