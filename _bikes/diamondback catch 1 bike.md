&#35;&#35;&#35; The Plus-Sized Trail Bike

Plus-sized mountain bikes are a great way to conquer the trails. With wider
tires, you'll have the sure-footed traction you need to ride anywhere. The
Diamondback Catch 1 Bike is designed with Level Link Suspension, modern
geometry, and wide, plus-sized tires. The hydroformed aluminum frame is
lightweight and durable, uses 130mm of travel on the front and rear, and
features ISCG-05 tabs and Boost spacing.

The Catch 1 comes with a SRAM SX Eagle 12-speed drivetrain. This includes a
cassette that has a hill-crushing 11-50T gear range that makes climbing and
pedaling through rough terrain a breeze. TRP Slate X2 hydraulic disc brakes
provide confidence-inspiring stopping power so you can descend under control.
Diamondback Blanchard 38R rims can be set up tubeless for a smoother ride,
better traction, and fewer flats. With the KS EXA Form 900i Dropper, you'll be
able to quickly lift and lower your saddle with the press of a lever.
