&#35;&#35;&#35; An Evil Bike That Is Good

Mountain bikes are ever-evolving. Every year mountain bikes get beefier,
lighter, and stiffer. Technology progresses rapidly leaving previous
generations in the dust. The Evil Offering GX Eagle Jenson USA Exclusive Build
is a mountain bike from Evil that has long travel and 29" wheels so riders can
conquer everything that is placed in front of them. It starts with a carbon
fiber frame that has the DELTA system, or better known as Dave's Extra
Legitimate Travel Apparatus. The DELTA system provides a supple feel early on
in the travel with a bottomless ramp at the end of the travel. The frame also
has a flip-chip that allows riders to be able to adjust their frame's geometry
on the fly by flipping the chip. This chip flip leaves the leverage rate curve
unchanged. All you're changing is the bottom bracket height and head angle.

This Jenson USA Exclusive Build comes expertly spec'd with a SRAM GX Eagle
12-speed drivetrain. This includes a cassette with an ultra-wide 10-52T gear
range that makes climbing and pedaling through rough terrain much easier.
Magura MT5 HC hydraulic disc brakes provide excellent stopping power so you
can descend under control. CrankBrothers Synthesis Enduro Alloy wheels are
paired with Kenda Hellkat tires that can be set up tubeless for a smoother
ride, better traction, and fewer flats. With the SDG Tellis Dropper Post,
you'll be able to quickly lift and lower your saddle with the press of a
lever.
