Trail bikes are designed to descend aggressively and also climb quickly. The Evil Following GX Eagle Bike is designed for riders who want to push past their limits and not have to worry about travel constraints. The unidirectional carbon frame is optimized for 120mm of travel on the rear and 120 to 130mm of travel on the front. The frame excels with both reduced and traditional offset forks and the frame features rubber sound-canceling chain-stay mounds, a direct-injection chainguide, a power-forward positioning, and a Miracle-Gro main pivot that provides flex-free durability.,The GX Eagle version of the Evil Following comes with a SRAM GX Eagle 12-speed drivetrain. This means you get a 12-speed cassette that has a hill-crushing 10-50-tooth gear range so you can dominate the hills and ride in rough terrain with ease. SRAM G2 RS hydraulic disc brakes provide excellent stopping power so you can descend with confidence and control. Industry Nine Enduro S Hydra wheels are paired with Maxxis Minion tires that can be set up tubeless so you can ditch the tubes and drop the tire pressure for a smoother ride, better traction, and fewer flats. A RockShox Reverb Stealth dropper post lets you quickly lift and lower your saddle so you can climb efficiently and descend with a lower center of gravity. With the RockShox suspension on the front and rear, you'll have a smooth ride everywhere you go.","images":["https://www.jensonusa.com/globalassets/product-images---all-assets/evil-bikes/bi001660-blackout-drunk.jpg","https://www.jensonusa.com/globalassets/product-images---all-assets/evil-bikes/bi001660-blackout-drunk-swatch.jpg"],"video":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/UctOICrgSBs","colors":"Blackout Drunk,Protein Powder","attributes":"{'Frame': 'Unidirectional Carbon Fiber', 'Fork': 'RockShox Pike Ultimate Charger 2 RC2, Debonair, 51mm Offset, 130mm', 'Rear Shock': 'RockShox Deluxe Ultimate RCT Debonair, Trunnion 165x45mm', 'Headset': 'FSA Integrated Tapered No.57/68', 'Shifters': 'SRAM GX Eagle, 12-Speed', 'Front Derailleur': 'Those still exist?', 'Rear Derailleur': 'SRAM GX Eagle', 'Crankset': 'SRAM GX Eagle DUB, SuperBoost+, 170mm, 32T', 'Bottom Bracket': 'SRAM DUB 73mm BSA', 'Chain': 'SRAM GX Eagle w/Powerlock', 'Cassette': 'SRAM XG-1275 Eagle, 10-50T', 'Brakes': 'SRAM G2 RS, 180mm Front, 180mm Rear', 'Wheelset': 'Industry Nine Enduro S Hydra, 15x110, 12x157mm', 'Tires': 'Maxxis Minion DHF EXO TR, 29 x 2.3\", Maxxis Minion DHF EXO TR, 29 x 2.3\"', 'Handlebar': 'RaceFace Chester 35, 35mm Rise', 'Stem': 'RaceFace Aeffect R 35', 'Grips/Bar Tape': 'Evil Palmela Handerson Lock-On', 'Seatpost': 'RockShox Reverb Stealth 30.9mm, 125mm (S), 150mm (M), 170mm (L/XL)', 'Seatclamp': 'Nutted', 'Saddle': 'WTB Volt Pro', 'Intended Use': 'Trail, All-Mountain'}","description":"EVIL FOLLOWING GX EAGLE BIKE 2020  MORE POP LESS FILLING  The type of frame you have will largely determine what type of riding you can do.

Niner’s e9 E-bike family consists of the RIP e9 and the WFO e9 bikes. Both of these bikes feature top-of-the-line Bosch Performance Line CX Motors and Rockshox suspensions. The CX motor provides up to 20 MPH of pedal assistance and up to 340% support in the turbo mode. Thanks to the Bosch’s Performance CX motor’s four separate power modes, you can choose between Eco, Tour, E-MTB, or Turbo modes to suit the type of riding you are doing. The performance line Power Tube 625wh battery lasts an average of 47miles per charge and the Bosch Purion display system provides you with all of your bike's data upfront. Flip Chip technology is incorporated into both bikes allowing you to change the geometry of the bike based on the type of riding you are doing. Both the RIP and the WFO e9 bikes run full SRAM 12-speed SX drivetrains and feature a SRAM PG1210 11-50 tooth cassette for a high-quality, hill-crushing setup. When it is time to bomb down that hill, you can rely on the SRAM GUIDE RE 4-piston brakes for superior stopping power. Whatever the type of riding you are doing, the Niner e9 bikes will allow you to rip farther and harder than you have ever before.,The WFO e9 bike is ready to tear up any downhill and help boost you up any technical climb with ease. The WFO e9 is the bigger, enduro, and downhill version that features the RockShox Super Deluxe Coil Select R for 180mm coil-sprung travel and the RockShox Yari RC 180mm Fork upfront. What really sets the WFO e9 bike apart from the rest is the mismatched wheel sizes. The WFO incorporates a 27.5\" rear wheel for playfulness and keeps a large 29” front tire for speed. This allows the WFO to feature characteristics of both a 27.5 bike and a 29er for the best of both worlds. The WFO e9 features even slacker geometry than the RIP e9, with a 63.5-degree head tube angle and a 76-degree seat tube angle in the ‘LOW’ setting, making this bike suitable to take on anything when the trail points downwards.","images":["https://www.jensonusa.com/globalassets/product-images---all-assets/niner/bi001714_1-magnetic-grey~orange-camo.jpg","https://www.jensonusa.com/globalassets/product-images---all-assets/niner/bi001714-magnetic-grey~orange-camo.jpg","https://www.jensonusa.com/globalassets/product-images---all-assets/niner/bi001714_2-magnetic-grey~orange-camo.jpg","https://www.jensonusa.com/globalassets/product-images---all-assets/niner/bi001714_3-magnetic-grey~orange-camo.jpg","https://www.jensonusa.com/globalassets/product-images---all-assets/niner/bi001714_4-magnetic-grey~orange-camo.jpg","https://www.jensonusa.com/globalassets/product-images---all-assets/niner/bi001714_5-magnetic-grey~orange-camo.jpg","https://www.jensonusa.com/globalassets/product-images---all-assets/niner/bi001714_6-magnetic-grey~orange-camo.jpg","https://www.jensonusa.com/globalassets/product-images---all-assets/niner/bi001714_7-magnetic-grey~orange-camo.jpg","https://www.jensonusa.com/globalassets/product-images---all-assets/niner/bi001714_8-magnetic-grey~orange-camo.jpg"],"colors":"Magnetic Grey/Orange Camo","attributes":"{'Frame': '6061 aluminum alloy, lifetime warranty', 'Fork': 'RockShox Yari RC 180mm travel 35mm stanchions, 44mm offset', 'Rear Shock': 'ROCKSHOX SUPER DELUXE COIL SELECT R 205X65MM TRUNNION', 'Headset': 'Niner ZS44/28.6 | ZS56/40', 'Shifters': 'SRAM 12spd SX Eagle', 'Front Derailleur': 'no', 'Rear Derailleur': 'SRAM 12 spd SX Eagle', 'Crankset': 'PRAXIS BOSCH G4 ISIS 165MM WITH SRAM DM EAGLE RING 36T', 'Bottom Bracket': '-', 'Chain': 'SRAM 12 spd SX Eagle', 'Cassette': 'SRAM PG1210 EAGLE 11-50T', 'Brakes': 'SRAM Guide RE brakes, 200mm centerline rotors', 'Wheelset': '29” Stans Flow D 148 X 12 rear, 110 x 15 front', 'Tires': 'Front: 29x2.5WT” Maxxis Minion DHF 3C/EXO/TR / Rear: 27.5 x2.8WT” Maxxis Aggressor 3C/EXO/TR', 'Handlebar': 'Race Face aeffect r 780mm wide, 20mm rise, 35mm clamp', 'Stem': 'Race Face Aeffect R 780mm Wide, 20mm Rise, 35mm Clamp', 'Grips/Bar Tape': 'Niner grrrips l/o nylon flanged', 'Seatpost': 'KS LEV SI (S-100MM, MD-125MM, LG-150MM)', 'Seatclamp': '34.9 Niner seat collar', 'Saddle': 'Niner custom tr with cr-mo rails, printed niner graphic', 'Intended Use': 'Enduro, Downhill, E-MTB', 'Motor': 'Bosch CX Performance Line', 'Battery': 'Power Tube 625wh battery', 'Display': 'Bosch Purion Display'}","description":"Niner WFO e9 EBike  Electrifying The Trails  Ninerrsquos first Ebikes are here Ninerrsquos e9 Ebike family consists of the RIP e9 and the WFO e9 bikes.

Ride Aligned is a sophisticated bike building system that helps design frames with unique geometry for every frame size based on the riders center of gravity and weight distribution. The result is a finely-tuned fit for riders of every frame size and bikes that feel like they were made specifically for you. The Norco Optic is a playful trail bike that was created for high-speed performance for today’s modern trail riders. Built to excel on fast and flowing single-track, this short -travel 29’er features a slack head tube angle for confidence on the descents and a steep seat tube angle for support on the climbs. Every aspect of the Optic, from the components to the geometry, has been focused around speed and agility for maximum trail-shredding performance. A relaxed head tube angle, a short stem, wide bars and reduced offset fork all aid in fine-tuning the Optic’s handling and predictability for fast and aggressive riding. A custom suspension design with precise spring and damping curves create one-of-a-kind suspension kinematics that only the Optic can touch.,The C1 build of the Norco Optic comes with expertly selected components, including a Shimano XTR drivetrain, a Fox Performance Elite suspension system, Shimano XTR brakes and Stan’s Flow S1 rims. For aggressive trail performance you are going to need aggressive suspension performance, so the Optic's best build was given the legendary Fox Performance Elite 36 Grip2 FLOAT 140mm fork and Fox Performance Elite FLOAT DPX2 rear shock. The complete Shimano XTR drivetrain sports a 10-51t cassette for a gravity-defying drivetrain. Shimano XTR four-piston M9120 Brakes have your back on the descents and supply confidence-inspiring stopping power. Lastly, Norco outfitted the Optic C1 build with Stan’s Flow S1 rims paired together with Shimano XT Boost center-lock hubs and premium Vittoria tires.","images":["https://www.jensonusa.com/globalassets/product-images---all-assets/norco/bi002055-green~copper.jpg","https://www.jensonusa.com/globalassets/product-images---all-assets/norco/bi002055_1-green~copper.jpg","https://www.jensonusa.com/globalassets/product-images---all-assets/norco/bi002055_2-green~copper.jpg","https://www.jensonusa.com/globalassets/product-images---all-assets/norco/bi002055_3-green~copper.jpg","https://www.jensonusa.com/globalassets/product-images---all-assets/norco/bi002055_4-green~copper.jpg"],"colors":"Green/Copper","attributes":"{'Frame': 'Carbon Front Triangle/Aluminum Rear, 125mm Travel', 'Fork': 'Fox Performance Elite 36 Grip2 FLOAT 140mm Travel, 42mm Offset', 'Rear Shock': 'Fox Performance Elite FLOAT DPX2, 190x45mm', 'Headset': 'FSA Internal Sealed Bearing', 'Shifters': 'Shimano XTR M9100 I-Spec', 'Front Derailleur': '-', 'Rear Derailleur': 'Shimano XTR M9100', 'Crankset': 'e*thirteen TRS Race Carbon, 32T, 170mm', 'Bottom Bracket': 'e*thirteen BB92', 'Chain': 'Shimano XTR M9100', 'Cassette': 'Shimano XTR CS-M9100, 10-51T, 12 Speed', 'Brakes': 'Shimano XTR M9120, 4 Piston, Organic Pads', 'Wheelset': 'Stans Flow S1 29\", 32H, Shimano XT HB-8110-B, 15x110mm/ 12x148mm Boost, Center Lock, Sapim Sprint DB Stainless', 'Tires': 'Front Tire: Vittoria Mazza 2.4\" Trail G 2.0 / Rear Tire: Vittoria Martello 2.35\" Trail G 2.0', 'Handlebar': 'One Up Carbon, 800mm, 20mm Rise', 'Stem': '6061 Alloy, 45mm Length, 35mm Clamp', 'Grips/Bar Tape': 'DMR Deathgrip', 'Seatpost': 'X-Fusion Manic dropper, 31.6mm, 125mm (S), 150mm (M,L), 170mm (XL)', 'Seatclamp': 'Norco Alloy Nutted Clamp', 'Saddle': 'Fizik Alpaca Terra, Wingflex', 'Intended Use': 'Trail'}","description":"Norco Optic C1 29 2021 Bike  Norco has reimagined what a modern trail bike is capable of and with help of their new Ride Aligned design system they created the Optic.

The fixed gear (or single speed) drivetrain keeps maintenance as simple as possible, making the Big Block a terrific commuter bike or general purpose bike for riders who like to spend as little time as possible working on their own bikes. Modern fixed gear geometry paired with the lively and springy nature of the Cromoly steel frame results in a nimble bike that dances up climbs and weaves through city streets. Tire clearance for up to 32c tires (or 28c with fenders) gives you the option to run your favorite wider tires for when the weather gets rough and the streets are tough. The lugged fork crown adds a touch of class and style and pairs perfectly with the classic style of the Big Block. A full E.D. coating and liquid paint ensures that the frame will look terrific and sparkle for years to come while keeping rust at bay.,For the complete Big Block build, All-City went with their in-house All-City 612 Track Cranks. The 612 Track Cranks are plenty stiff for sprinting around town or for the occasional track race. They come in a 165mm length configuration which is a must for cornering on a fixed gear. The 46t chainring features a track standard 144bcd, which allows you to easily swap out the chainring for just about any track chainring on the market. The 46t chainring in conjunction with the 17t cog provides a solid gearing ratio that’s perfect for city mashing where starting and stopping quickly is key. Wheels are ever-reliable Alex DH19 32h rims laced to smooth JoyTech A566 hubs. Wrapped around the rims are a set of incredibly durable 28mm Vittoria Zaffiros IV tires. The all AL6061 alloy cockpit is supplied by JD components with the bars coming in at a wide 720mm width for maximum control and leverage. Whether you’re conquering the streets or lining up at the velodrome, the All-City Big Block can do it all.","images":["https://www.jensonusa.com/globalassets/product-images---all-assets/all-city-2021/bi002522-night-sky~smoke.jpg","https://www.jensonusa.com/globalassets/product-images---all-assets/all-city-2021/bi002522_1-night-sky~smoke.jpg","https://www.jensonusa.com/globalassets/product-images---all-assets/all-city-2021/bi002522_2-night-sky~smoke.jpg","https://www.jensonusa.com/globalassets/product-images---all-assets/all-city-2021/bi002522_3-night-sky~smoke.jpg"],"colors":"Night Sky/Smoke","attributes":"{'Frame': '612 Select Chromoly Steel', 'Fork': 'All-City Big Block Signature Fork', 'Headset': 'Cane Creek 40 Series, EC34/28.6 Upper, EC34/30 Lower', 'Shifters': 'Nope', 'Front Derailleur': 'Nada', 'Rear Derailleur': 'Zilch', 'Crankset': 'All-City 612 Track Crank, 165mm, 46T Chainring', 'Bottom Bracket': 'Square Taper 68x110mm Steel Cups, Sealed Bearings', 'Chain': 'KMC Silver, ⅛”', 'Cassette/Cog': 'All-City Standard, 17T', 'Brakes': 'Tektro R539 Calipers, Tektro FL750 Lever', 'Wheelset': 'Alex DH19 Rims, 32h, With CNC Brake Track Laced To JoyTech A566, 32h Hubs', 'Tires': \"Vittoria Zaffiro's IV, 700c x 28mm\", 'Handlebar': 'JD Components, AL6061, 720mm Wide, 20mm rise', 'Stem': 'JD Components, AL6061, 3D Forged, 4-Bolt Stem, 31.8mm, ±7-Degree', 'Grips/Bar Tape': 'Velo Single Lock-On', 'Seatpost': 'JD Components, AL6061, 27.2, 12mm Offset', 'Seatclamp': 'All-City Brazed On', 'Saddle': 'All-City Gonzo', 'Intended Use': 'Track Racing, Commuting, General Fixie Tomfoolery'}","description":"AllCity Big Block 700c Bike 2021  DoitAll City Shredder  The Big Block has long been AllCityrsquos doitall city shredder bombproof commuter and near indestructible track bike for years.
