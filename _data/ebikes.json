The 2020 Wreckoning inherits 5mm more of rear travel over the previous version, maxing out at 166mm. All builds come stock with the Rockshox Super Deluxe Coil Ultimate rear shock for excellent small bump sensitivity and the Rockshox Lyrik Ultimate Charger 2.1 RC2 170mm Fork to soak up anything on the trail. Evil also upped the ante and stuck a pair of Industry Nine Enduro S Hydra wheels on each build, outfitting your bike with the some of the smoothest wheels on the market. Evilâs revolutionary Delta Link system has also been given a makeover, with Dual-row, angular-contact, KlÃ¼berplex-filled bearings and oversized pivot hardware for superior durability and longevity. 157mm SuperBoost spacing has been implemented for stiffer and fast handling and an integrated chain guide provides lightweight chain retention. Full internal cable routing produces a well-maintained look and internal tubes help keep everything together. The Wrekoning allows you to change the geometry of your bike based on the type of riding you are doing.

Its 612 Select Cromoly steel frame strikes a solid balance of weight, durability, and comfort. The fixed gear (or single speed) drivetrain keeps maintenance as simple as possible, making the Big Block a terrific commuter bike or general purpose bike for riders who like to spend as little time as possible working on their own bikes. Modern fixed gear geometry paired with the lively and springy nature of the Cromoly steel frame results in a nimble bike that dances up climbs and weaves through city streets. Tire clearance for up to 32c tires (or 28c with fenders) gives you the option to run your favorite wider tires for when the weather gets rough and the streets are tough. The lugged fork crown adds a touch of class and style and pairs perfectly with the classic style of the Big Block. A full E.D. coating and liquid paint ensures that the frame will look terrific and sparkle for years to come while keeping rust at bay.,For the complete Big Block build, All-City went with their in-house All-City 612 Track Cranks. The 612 Track Cranks are plenty stiff for sprinting around town or for the occasional track race. They come in a 165mm length configuration which is a must for cornering on a fixed gear. The 46t chainring features a track standard 144bcd, which allows you to easily swap out the chainring for just about any track chainring on the market. The 46t chainring in conjunction with the 17t cog provides a solid gearing ratio thatâs perfect for city mashing where starting and stopping quickly is key. Wheels are ever-reliable Alex DH19 32h rims laced to smooth JoyTech A566 hubs. Wrapped around the rims are a set of incredibly durable 28mm Vittoria Zaffiros IV tires. The all AL6061 alloy cockpit is supplied by JD components with the bars coming in at a wide 720mm width for maximum control and leverage. Whether youâre conquering the streets or lining up at the velodrome, the All-City Big Block can do it all.","images":["https://www.jensonusa.com/globalassets/product-images---all-assets/all-city-2021/bi002522-night-sky~smoke.jpg","https://www.jensonusa.com/globalassets/product-images---all-assets/all-city-2021/bi002522_1-night-sky~smoke.jpg","https://www.jensonusa.com/globalassets/product-images---all-assets/all-city-2021/bi002522_2-night-sky~smoke.jpg","https://www.jensonusa.com/globalassets/product-images---all-assets/all-city-2021/bi002522_3-night-sky~smoke.jpg"],"colors":["Night Sky/Smoke"],"attributes":"{'Frame': '612 Select Chromoly Steel', 'Fork': 'All-City Big Block Signature Fork', 'Headset': 'Cane Creek 40 Series, EC34/28.6 Upper, EC34/30 Lower', 'Shifters': 'Nope', 'Front Derailleur': 'Nada', 'Rear Derailleur': 'Zilch', 'Crankset': 'All-City 612 Track Crank, 165mm, 46T Chainring', 'Bottom Bracket': 'Square Taper 68x110mm Steel Cups, Sealed Bearings', 'Chain': 'KMC Silver, ââ', 'Cassette/Cog': 'All-City Standard, 17T', 'Brakes': 'Tektro R539 Calipers, Tektro FL750 Lever', 'Wheelset': 'Alex DH19 Rims, 32h, With CNC Brake Track Laced To JoyTech A566, 32h Hubs', 'Tires': \"Vittoria Zaffiro's IV, 700c x 28mm\", 'Handlebar': 'JD Components, AL6061, 720mm Wide, 20mm rise', 'Stem': 'JD Components, AL6061, 3D Forged, 4-Bolt Stem, 31.8mm, Â±7-Degree', 'Grips/Bar Tape': 'Velo Single Lock-On', 'Seatpost': 'JD Components, AL6061, 27.2, 12mm Offset', 'Seatclamp': 'All-City Brazed On', 'Saddle': 'All-City Gonzo', 'Intended Use': 'Track Racing, Commuting, General Fixie Tomfoolery'}","description":"AllCity Big Block 700c Bike 2021  DoitAll City Shredder  The Big Block has long been AllCityrsquos doitall city shredder bombproof commuter and near indestructible track bike for years.

Theyâre made to go anywhere, do anything, and put a smile on your face while youâre riding them. For the Gorilla Monsoon, All City used their classic recipe of two parts steel and one big cup of fun, but added in a special blend of one part tire clearance and a splash of rowdiness. In the classic All-City fashion, the Gorilla Monsoon is built around a sporty 612 select tubing steel frame for maximum durability and that springy ride quality that only steel offers. Its comfortable geometry makes it a very stable platform, resulting in a confidence inspiring ride. Wide tire clearance for up to 27.5x2.4â (or 700x42mm) lets you explore with full on mountain bike tires and allows you to run a plethora of tire choices. Modern features like internal dropper post routing, flat mount brakes, and 12mm thru axles ensures that the Gorilla Monsoon is plenty futureproof. Integrated fenders and rack mounts let you turn it into a bad weather commuter, bikepackers dream machine, or even just a super rad grocery getter. All-Cityâs attention to detail doesnât go unnoticed with additional touches like E.D. coating to protect against rust, liquid paint for a long lasting paint job, lugged fork for a touch of nostalgia, and reinforced bottle bosses because, well, why not? If we were to summarize the Gorilla Monsoon we would say itâs the cycling industry leader in fun.,For the APEX level build, All-City went with the ever reliable SRAM APEX 1x11-speed drivetrain. The 11-42T cassette paired with the 38T chainring on the FSA Comet crankset provides an excellent range of gears fit for everything from bikepacking exploration to quick singletrack rips and everything in between. Braking is handled by a set of Tektro mechanical disc brakes, which are easy to adjust and offer reliable braking performance. If we direct our attention to the seatpost youâll find a TranzX dropper with 50mm of travel. 50mm of travel may not sound like a lot, but itâs quite perfect for most gravel and adventure riding where shifting your weight back and around the bike gives you a boost of confidence and allows you to ride more terrain quicker and with more control. For wheels, All-City went with a set of WTB ST i25 tubeless rims laced to a set of easy to service Novatec hubs. This combination translates into a reliable tubeless wheelset thatâs ready to take on any challenge. For tires youâll find a set of tubeless WTB Riddlerâs in a 27.5x2.4â configuration wrapped around the rims. These tires come in the light/fast casing option which when paired with the excellent all-around tire tread of the Riddler promises a fast and grippy experience thatâs perfect for a variety of riding scenarios.","images":["https://www.jensonusa.com/globalassets/product-images---all-assets/all-city-2021/bi002911-charred-berry.jpg","https://www.jensonusa.com/globalassets/product-images---all-assets/all-city-2021/bi002911_1-charred-berry.jpg","https://www.jensonusa.com/globalassets/product-images---all-assets/all-city-2021/bi002911_2-charred-berry.jpg","https://www.jensonusa.com/globalassets/product-images---all-assets/all-city-2021/bi002911_3-charred-berry.jpg"],"colors":["Charred Berry"],"attributes":"{'Frame': '612 Select Chromoly Steel, TIG Welded And Brazed, E.D.
