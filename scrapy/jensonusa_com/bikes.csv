Niner’s e9 E-bike family consists of the RIP e9 and the WFO e9 bikes. Both of these bikes feature top-of-the-line Bosch Performance Line CX Motors and Rockshox suspensions. The CX motor provides up to 20 MPH of pedal assistance and up to 340% support in the turbo mode. Thanks to the Bosch’s Performance CX motor’s four separate power modes, you can choose between Eco, Tour, E-MTB, or Turbo modes to suit the type of riding you are doing. The performance line Power Tube 625wh battery lasts an average of 47miles per charge and the Bosch Purion display system provides you with all of your bike's data upfront. Flip Chip technology is incorporated into both bikes allowing you to change the geometry of the bike based on the type of riding you are doing. Both the RIP and the WFO e9 bikes run full SRAM 12-speed SX drivetrains and feature a SRAM PG1210 11-50 tooth cassette for a high-quality, hill-crushing setup.

What really sets the WFO e9 bike apart from the rest is the mismatched wheel sizes. The WFO incorporates a 27.5"" rear wheel for playfulness and keeps a large 29” front tire for speed. This allows the WFO to feature characteristics of both a 27.5 bike and a 29er for the best of both worlds. The WFO e9 features even slacker geometry than the RIP e9, with a 63.5-degree head tube angle and a 76-degree seat tube angle in the ‘LOW’ setting, making this bike suitable to take on anything when the trail points downwards.","https://www.jensonusa.com/globalassets/product-images---all-assets/niner/bi001714_1-magnetic-grey~orange-camo.jpg,https://www.jensonusa.com/globalassets/product-images---all-assets/niner/bi001714-magnetic-grey~orange-camo.jpg,https://www.jensonusa.com/globalassets/product-images---all-assets/niner/bi001714_2-magnetic-grey~orange-camo.jpg,https://www.jensonusa.com/globalassets/product-images---all-assets/niner/bi001714_3-magnetic-grey~orange-camo.jpg,https://www.jensonusa.com/globalassets/product-images---all-assets/niner/bi001714_4-magnetic-grey~orange-camo.jpg,https://www.jensonusa.com/globalassets/product-images---all-assets/niner/bi001714_5-magnetic-grey~orange-camo.jpg,https://www.jensonusa.com/globalassets/product-images---all-assets/niner/bi001714_6-magnetic-grey~orange-camo.jpg,https://www.jensonusa.com/globalassets/product-images---all-assets/niner/bi001714_7-magnetic-grey~orange-camo.jpg,https://www.jensonusa.com/globalassets/product-images---all-assets/niner/bi001714_8-magnetic-grey~orange-camo.jpg",,Magnetic Grey/Orange Camo,"{'Frame': '6061 aluminum alloy, lifetime warranty', 'Fork': 'RockShox Yari RC 180mm travel 35mm stanchions, 44mm offset', 'Rear Shock': 'ROCKSHOX SUPER DELUXE COIL SELECT R 205X65MM TRUNNION', 'Headset': 'Niner ZS44/28.6 | ZS56/40', 'Shifters': 'SRAM 12spd SX Eagle', 'Front Derailleur': 'no', 'Rear Derailleur': 'SRAM 12 spd SX Eagle', 'Crankset': 'PRAXIS BOSCH G4 ISIS 165MM WITH SRAM DM EAGLE RING 36T', 'Bottom Bracket': '-', 'Chain': 'SRAM 12 spd SX Eagle', 'Cassette': 'SRAM PG1210 EAGLE 11-50T', 'Brakes': 'SRAM Guide RE brakes, 200mm centerline rotors', 'Wheelset': '29” Stans Flow D 148 X 12 rear, 110 x 15 front', 'Tires': 'Front: 29x2.5WT” Maxxis Minion DHF 3C/EXO/TR / Rear: 27.5 x2.8WT” Maxxis Aggressor 3C/EXO/TR', 'Handlebar': 'Race Face aeffect r 780mm wide, 20mm rise, 35mm clamp', 'Stem': 'Race Face Aeffect R 780mm Wide, 20mm Rise, 35mm Clamp', 'Grips/Bar Tape': 'Niner grrrips l/o nylon flanged', 'Seatpost': 'KS LEV SI (S-100MM, MD-125MM, LG-150MM)', 'Seatclamp': '34.9 Niner seat collar', 'Saddle': 'Niner custom tr with cr-mo rails, printed niner graphic', 'Intended Use': 'Enduro, Downhill, E-MTB', 'Motor': 'Bosch CX Performance Line', 'Battery': 'Power Tube 625wh battery', 'Display': 'Bosch Purion Display'}",Niner WFO e9 EBike  Electrifying The Trails  Ninerrsquos first Ebikes are here Ninerrsquos e9 Ebike family consists of the RIP e9 and the WFO e9 bikes.

Modern fixed gear geometry paired with the lively and springy nature of the Cromoly steel frame results in a nimble bike that dances up climbs and weaves through city streets. Tire clearance for up to 32c tires (or 28c with fenders) gives you the option to run your favorite wider tires for when the weather gets rough and the streets are tough.

A full E.D. coating and liquid paint ensures that the frame will look terrific and sparkle for years to come while keeping rust at bay.,For the complete Big Block build, All-City went with their in-house All-City 612 Track Cranks. The 612 Track Cranks are plenty stiff for sprinting around town or for the occasional track race. They come in a 165mm length configuration which is a must for cornering on a fixed gear. The 46t chainring features a track standard 144bcd, which allows you to easily swap out the chainring for just about any track chainring on the market.

Built around a lightweight, stiff, and robust carbon frame, the Blur is extremely nimble and practically dances up climbs and doesn’t waste any watts in the process. The new Blur frame has shaved off a whopping 289g over the previous generation Blur frame due to a variety of engineering changes, including a switch from VPP to the all new Superlight suspension platform. The Superlight suspension platform utilizes a single pivot point and flexible chainstays instead of a more traditional VPP style platform. This not only allowed Santa Cruz’s engineers to shed weight off of the bike but it also allowed them to increase stiffness, traction, and sensitivity in both climbing and descending scenarios. The Blur TR takes the normal cross country race focused superlight platform and bumps the rear travel up from 100mm to 115mm and bumps the front fork travel up from 100mm to 120mm. Pair the increased travel with a 67.1-degre headtube angle, modern reach number, and you’ve got a bike that’s able to get more rowdy and handle more challenging terrain, which makes the Blur TR a truly modern down country machine. Wide tire clearance for up to 2.4” tires lets you run your favorite tire combination. Two water bottle cage mounts inside the frame and one mount on the downtube means you’ll never run out of water and makes the Blur TR perfect for long marathon races and bikepacking expeditions where refueling half way through isn’t an option. A threaded bottom bracket and standard headset bearings ensure that maintenance will be simple.,For the S tier Blur TR build Santa Cruz went with the ever reliable SRAM GX Eagle drivetrain. The GX Eagle drivetrain features a 1x12-speed drivetrain with a massive 10-50t cassette, ensuring you’ll be able to climb, if not sprint up just about any hill. Braking is handled by SRAM Level TL brakes. Level TL brakes offer solid braking power and modulation. Up front is a Fox 34 Step Cast Performance fork in the 120mm travel configuration. Unlike the standard Blur, the Blur TR utilizes a Fox 34 Step Cast fork which weighs slightly more than its 32 Step Cast brother but makes up for it with a stiffer and more robust chassis and larger 34mm stanchions, not to mention a 20mm increase in travel. Out back is Fox’s Performance DPS rear shock which offers ample adjustment and tunability. For wheels Santa Cruz went with tubeless ready RaceFace AR 27 rims laced to DT Swiss 370 hubs. This combination strikes a solid balance of reliability, reasonably lightweight, and easily serviceable design.

For 2022 the Chameleon has truly become a genre defying bike. It’s equally at home ripping singletrack, hitting up the local dirt jumps, exploring the backcountry on a bikepacking adventure, or just about anything else you can think of. The all-new frame has stayed true to its no-nonsense aluminum roots and is just as durable and bombproof as ever. Progressive geometry with a 65-degree headtube angle and long reach numbers paired with a 130mm fork and short stem provide a snappy and playful riding experience. Clearance for up to 29”x2.6” or 27.5”x2.8” tires means you can run just about any tire setup under the sun. A triple-bolt cargo mount on the downtube and a double-bolt mount on the seatube let you carry just about anything, making the Chameleon an excellent option for bikepacking-curious mountain bikers. Sliding dropouts let you adjust the geometry of the chameleon, allowing you to make the bike longer and more stable or shorter and snappier. The sliding dropouts also lets riders experiment with singlespeed drivetrains if they so choose. A standard 73mm threaded bottom bracket and integrated headset keeps maintenance simple. The Santa Cruz Chameleon is the bike that’ll always put a smile on your face and is ready for anything you want to throw at it. We implore Chameleon riders to tinker with their bike and make it their own, because it truly is a versatile bike that can adapt to just about any rider's needs.,For the “D” level build, Santa Cruz went with a blend of NX and SX 1x12-speed SRAM Eagle components.

The Eminent Onset LT is Eminent’s mid-travel 29er that was designed for speed, versatility, and agility on the descents and can still deliver superior climbing performance. The Onset LT shares the same AFS suspension technology as its shorter and longer-travel siblings but in an aggressive all-mountain frame design. The balanced suspension kinematics combined with the square tubing makes for an ultra-stiff frame that has perfect anti-squat characteristics. A 66-degree headtube angle, paired together with a 76-degree seat tube angle, makes for an aggressive mountain bike that is eager to rip down technical single-track but still able to conquer climbs with ease. For the finishing touches, the unidirectional carbon fiber frame has internal cable routing, integrated ISCG05 mounts, a carbon downtube protector, and an integrated seat clamp for a clean-looking and efficient design.,The Advanced build of the Eminent Onset LT features a Shimano 12-speed drivetrain, a complete Fox suspension set and Crankbrothers Synthesis Enduro I9 wheels. The Shimano XT, 12-speed drivetrain provides an impressive 10-51 tooth gear range for confidence in getting up any hill.

With a full suspension platform you’ll be more confident while descending, more comfortable on bumpier sections, and have increased traction on the climbs. When the dirt turns to pavement you can easily lock out the suspension with a push of a button, effectively turning the MCR into a rigid gravel bike.

The lightweight Niner RDO carbon fiber frame keeps the bike feeling lightweight and agile while putting the power down. Tire clearance for up to 700x50c or 650bx2.0” tires means you can run your favorite tire combination. 11 fixed mounting points let you bring just about any bag or bottle combination under the sun. Fully integrated internal dropper post support gives you the option to get extra rowdy on the descents and technical singletrack.,For the 4-Star build Niner decided to go with the fan favorite Shimano GRX800 2x11-speed for the drivetrain and brakes. The GRX800 drivetrain offers a reliable and crisp shifting with a wide range of gears to help you tackle the toughest climbs and the steepest descents. Paired up with the GRX800 drivetrain are the ultra lightweight and incredibly stiff Easton EC90 carbon cranks. GRX800 hydraulic brakes stop on a dime, are consistently powerful while also offering excellent modulation, and are easy to bleed. Suspension up front is handled by the ever popular FOX 32 SC AX Performance Elite fork in a 40mm travel configuration paired with the very tuneable FIT4 damper. The FIT4 damper eliminates small bumps and washboard chatter. Suspension out back is a X-Fusion Microlite which has been tuned to deal with high frequency bumps while also providing maximum comfort and traction over long distances. Tubeless ready DT Swiss G1800 Spline 25’s are lightweight, accelerate quickly, and provide a great platform for wider tires. Paired with the DT Swiss wheels are a set of Schwalbe G-One Allround Evo tires in 700x38c, these tires strike the perfect balance of speed, suppleness, and grip making them the perfect multi surface tire. As for the finishing kit it’s handled by both Niner and Easton.,ul>,

They’re made to go anywhere, do anything, and put a smile on your face while you’re riding them. For the Gorilla Monsoon, All City used their classic recipe of two parts steel and one big cup of fun, but added in a special blend of one part tire clearance and a splash of rowdiness. In the classic All-City fashion, the Gorilla Monsoon is built around a sporty 612 select tubing steel frame for maximum durability and that springy ride quality that only steel offers. Its comfortable geometry makes it a very stable platform, resulting in a confidence inspiring ride. Wide tire clearance for up to 27.5x2.4” (or 700x42mm) lets you explore with full on mountain bike tires and allows you to run a plethora of tire choices. Modern features like internal dropper post routing, flat mount brakes, and 12mm thru axles ensures that the Gorilla Monsoon is plenty futureproof. Integrated fenders and rack mounts let you turn it into a bad weather commuter, bikepackers dream machine, or even just a super rad grocery getter. All-City’s attention to detail doesn’t go unnoticed with additional touches like E.D. coating to protect against rust, liquid paint for a long lasting paint job, lugged fork for a touch of nostalgia, and reinforced bottle bosses because, well, why not? If we were to summarize the Gorilla Monsoon we would say it’s the cycling industry leader in fun.,For the APEX level build, All-City went with the ever reliable SRAM APEX 1x11-speed drivetrain. The 11-42T cassette paired with the 38T chainring on the FSA Comet crankset provides an excellent range of gears fit for everything from bikepacking exploration to quick singletrack rips and everything in between. Braking is handled by a set of Tektro mechanical disc brakes, which are easy to adjust and offer reliable braking performance. If we direct our attention to the seatpost you’ll find a TranzX dropper with 50mm of travel. 50mm of travel may not sound like a lot, but it’s quite perfect for most gravel and adventure riding where shifting your weight back and around the bike gives you a boost of confidence and allows you to ride more terrain quicker and with more control. For wheels, All-City went with a set of WTB ST i25 tubeless rims laced to a set of easy to service Novatec hubs. This combination translates into a reliable tubeless wheelset that’s ready to take on any challenge. For tires you’ll find a set of tubeless WTB Riddler’s in a 27.5x2.4” configuration wrapped around the rims. These tires come in the light/fast casing option which when paired with the excellent all-around tire tread of the Riddler promises a fast and grippy experience that’s perfect for a variety of riding scenarios.","https://www.jensonusa.com/globalassets/product-images---all-assets/all-city-2021/bi002911-charred-berry.jpg,https://www.jensonusa.com/globalassets/product-images---all-assets/all-city-2021/bi002911_1-charred-berry.jpg,https://www.jensonusa.com/globalassets/product-images---all-assets/all-city-2021/bi002911_2-charred-berry.jpg,https://www.jensonusa.com/globalassets/product-images---all-assets/all-city-2021/bi002911_3-charred-berry.jpg",,Charred Berry,"{'Frame': '612 Select Chromoly Steel, TIG Welded And Brazed, E.D.
